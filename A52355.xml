            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A BRIEF EXPOSITION Of the firſt Epiſtle General of PETER.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough this Apoſtle was in a very mean exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition before his calling, <hi>Mat. 4, 18.</hi> and wanted not his manifold failings thereafter, <hi>Mat. 16.22.</hi> and <hi>26.70. Gal. 2.14.</hi> Yet by the free grace of God, he was honoured to be an eye-witneſs of Chriſts greateſt glory on earth, <hi>Mat. 17.1.</hi> and of his ſaddeſt ſufferings, <hi>Mat. 26.27.</hi> to convert many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls, <hi>Act. 2.41.</hi> to write this excellent Scripture, and to die a Martir, <hi>2 Pet. 1.14.</hi> compared with <hi>Joh. 21.18, 19.</hi> All which conſiderations of him, may ſerve to commend to the Church the truths delivered by him.</p>
               <p>The Epiſtle is directed to the Chriſtian Jews, of whom he had gotten a special charge, <hi>Gal. 2.7.</hi> and of whoſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had been a prime inſtrument, <hi>Act. 2.9, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpecial occaſion of his writing to them, (as appears by the ſtrain of his Doctrine) was the rage of Perſecution, the prevailing of Error, and ſome decay of grace and holineſs among them, together with the preſent opportunity of a ſin Meſſenger to carry the Epiſtle, <hi>1 Pet. 5.12.</hi> who had a calling to interpret, and publickly to explain the ſame to them, <hi>2 Cor. 1.19.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His principal ſcope, is, to confirm Believers in the Truth, to ſtir them up to conſtancy and chearfulneſs under their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105751:4"/>
for it, to grow in grace, and to adorn their profeſſion by a holy walking in their ſeveral relations, as appears by comparing <hi>1 Pet. 5.12.</hi> where he reſumes his ſcope in this Epiſtle, with <hi>2 Pet. 3.1.</hi> where he expreſſeth his ſcope in both.</p>
               <p>The principal parts of this Epiſtle are three. In the firſt (after the Preface, <hi>Chap. 1. ver. 1, 2.</hi>) the Apoſtle giveth ſuch a deſcription of the excellent spiritual condition of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as might provoke them to joy under their ſaddeſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and engage them to theſe duties of holineſs which he preſſeth in the reſt of the Epiſtle: and this is to the <hi>13. ver.</hi> of the <hi>1. chap.</hi> The ſecond part containeth ſeveral exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with motives preſſing the ſame, to ſuch duties of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as that moſt excellent ſtate doth oblige all Chriſtians unto, whatſoever their relations or condition be in the world: and this is to the <hi>13. ver.</hi> of the <hi>2. chap.</hi> In the third part, the Apoſtle preſſeth ſuch duties of holineſs as are ſuitable for Chriſtians, conſidered under their Civil, Domeſtick, or Church relations, and especially ſuch as belong to thoſe who are in a condition of ſuffering for Chriſt and his Truth: and this is to the <hi>10. ver.</hi> of the <hi>5. chap.</hi> After which is the cloſe of the whole Epiſtle.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He parts of this Chapter are two. In the firſt (after the Preface of the whole Epiſtle, containing a deſcription of the Pen-man of it, and of the parties to whom it is directed, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2.) the Apoſtle incites ſuffering Chriſtians to praiſe God, by raiſing the ſong before them: wherein he makes clear how excellent their ſpiritual eſtate was; and holds forth what reaſons they had from it of chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and conſtancy under all their ſufferings, to wit, 1. Their regeneration, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 2. Their matchleſs inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 3. The certainty of their perſeverance, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. 4.

The excellency of the Doctrine of Salvation for which they did ſuffer, which is proven by the great pains and delight of the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Angels in the ſtudy thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond part, are contained ſeveral exhortations to the ſtudy of holineſs, with motives preſſing the ſame: As, 1. Seing they had thoſe excellent priviledges former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, they ſhould therefore ſtudy perſeverance, and growth in grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 2. Conſidering that they were now made <hi>Children,</hi> they ſhould therefore ſtudy their Fathers obedience, and not live as they had done formerly, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 3. Seing their Calling was to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And, 4. the holineſs of God did oblige them to that ſtudy, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. 5. Since their Father was to be their Judge. And, 6. themſelves were but ſtrangers in the world, Therefore they ſhould live in fear of offending him, <hi>v.</hi> 17. 7. Conſidering that they were bought from their former ſinfull courſes with a moſt excellent price, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. 8. That their Redeemer was from eternity deſigned for them, and more clearly manifeſted in their time than formerly, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. 9. Seing the Father hath exalted Chriſt after his ſufferings, that Believers may be the more confident that Juſtice is fully ſatisfied for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. And, 10. ſeing they had already made ſome good progreſs in mortification, therefore they ſhould ſtudy to grow, eſpecially in love to the Saints, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. 11. Conſidering that their ſpiritual original was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. And laſtly, that their ſpiritual eſtate was not fading, as the beſt things in nature are, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. but behoved to endure for ever, as the Word, which is the principle of it, doth, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. Therefore they ought to live to their Fathers honour in the ſtudy of holineſs.</p>

Next he deſcribeth the perſons to whom this Epiſtle was firſt directed, from their afflicted external condition, to wit, that they were baniſhed from their own Country and wonted priviledges, and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many places of the world, whereof ſome are here mentioned. From the Apoſtles deſcription of himſelf, we may <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt are entring upon any part of their publick Employment, it is then eſpecially neceſſary for them to have in their hearts the ſenſible conſideration, of what honour Chriſt hath put upon them, what engagements to be faithful to Him, what warrant they have from Him to go about their Employment, and what an one He is from whom they have their Calling, that ſo they may carry along in their hearts ſome holy fear of ſlighting the work of ſuch a one as the Son of God, to whom they muſt give an account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. and may have much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſidering that their Commiſſion is from Him, who hath all fulneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. to furniſh them, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the peoples neceſſities: for, the Apoſtle, entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this part of his employment, to wit, the writing of this Epiſtle, hath had in heart the conſideration of that new name wherewith Chriſt honoured him, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by He would have him conſtantly mindful of his duty, that he ſhould be according to the ſignification of his name, interpreted by Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.42. ſteadfaſt as a

                     <hi>Rock</hi> or <hi>Stone</hi> in his Maſters ſervice; and likewiſe of his Commiſſion from ſo honourable and glorious a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as the anointed Saviour of Sinners, while he writes, <hi>Peter an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. When the meſſage of Chriſts Miniſters is much ſlighted, and oppoſed, and their Calling much queſtioned, it is neceſſary for them openly to avow and aſſert their Authority from Him; that people, perceiving Miniſters not afraid to avow themſelves, and their Calling from Chriſt, upon all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, may be encouraged to imbrace and adhere to the Truths they deliver; and having their minds raiſed above inſtruments, the Truths delivered may have the greater weight with them: for, upon theſe grounds we may ſafely conceive the Apoſtle to prefix his name to this Epiſtle, and to avow his Office, even in a time of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; <hi>Peter an Apoſtle of Jeſus Christ.</hi> 3. There hath never been any ſupremacy over the reſt of the Apoſtles, conferred upon <hi>Peter,</hi> neither did he ever aſſume any ſuch thing to himſelf; and conſequently did never caſt a copy to any Miniſter to uſurp, or affect any ſuch thing over their fellow-labourers: for, if there had been any ſuch thing, of ſo great concernment as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes it, it cannot be thought, but this Apoſtle would have found himſelf bound to aſſert it: which if he had done any where, it could not be expected in a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place, than in the entry of his Writings, where the Prophets and Apoſtles uſually aſſert to themſelves as much dignity as the Lord allows them; And yet neither here, nor in the following Epiſtle, is there any ſuch thing, but at the moſt, <hi>Peter an Apoſtle</hi> (or, Meſſenger) <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the firſt branch of the deſcription of thoſe to whom the Epiſtle is directed, we may <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That exile, and ſeparation from outward comforts and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, may be the lot of the people who are deareſt to the Lord of any on earth beſides; even thoſe may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and humbled for the abuſe of their mercies, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 89.30. and by their means, in their exile and ſcattering,

the Lord minds to ſpread the ſeeds of ſaving knowledge among ſtrangers to Him, <hi>Micah</hi> 5.7. <hi>Zach.</hi> 10.9. for which, and the like cauſes, the Chriſtian Hebrews, to whom the Apoſtle writes, were called here <hi>ſtrangers ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Although the Lords afflicted people, by reaſon of their ignorance and unbelief, are very prone to conclude themſelves forgotten and forſaken of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. Yet thoſe, who under their affliction are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves for ſin, and cleaving to the Truth and way of God, may be confident, that the Lord not only takes notice of their ſad condition, and of all the places of their ſufferings; but that He will provide ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for them there, while He hath ſervice for them; and will alſo, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This laſt part of the Inſcription, contains the ſecond branch of the Deſcription of thoſe to whom the Epiſtle is directed, together with the Apoſtles ſalutation of them. They are here deſcribed from their moſt excellent ſpiritual condition, to comfort them againſt their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſad outward condition, to wit, that they were wailed out from among others, as the word <hi>Elect</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, which may be ſafely underſtood both of the Lords eternal purpoſe of love toward them, in which ſenſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105751:6"/>
the word <hi>Elect</hi> is taken, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. as alſo of his actual ſeparating of them from the reſt of the world in their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Calling, as the word is taken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. And that not for any foreſeen good that they were to do, but according as the Lord, in his eternal foreknowledge, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all <hi>Adam's</hi> poſterity in his eye, had freely conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended upon them, and appointed them to come by the way of faith and holineſſe (which his own Spirit was to work in them) to the full enjoyment of all that Chriſt had purchaſed for them, by his fulfilling of the Law, and ſatisfying for the breach thereof. To theſe, in the ſalutation, the Apoſtle wiſheth the proofs of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in a continual increaſe of all ſaving graces, and true peace, with God, with others, and with their own conſciences. From this ſecond branch of the Deſcription of thoſe to whom the Epiſtle is directed, we may <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although none, in an ordinary way, can infallibly know the election, or effectual calling of another, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. yet it is not impoſſible for the Elect and Called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to attain to ſome comfortable meaſure of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, the Lord having taken ſo much pains to give the marks of ſuch in his Word, and to deſcribe a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work by the effects thereof, which are proper to the Elect and effectually called Ones, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 9. and having promiſed his Spirit to make his own know their priviledges, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. for, it is aſſerted here, as Chriſtians chief Conſolation againſt their ſad outward condition ſpoken of before, that they are <hi>Elect;</hi> Now this could be no more conſolation to them that were eternally elected, and effectually called, than to any other Members of the Church, except they might know themſelves to be ſuch as are here deſcribed; and there can be no queſtion but their conſolation is mainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, while they are thus ſpoken to, <hi>Elect, according to the foreknowledge of God.</hi>

ground for others to eſteem and deal with them, as with thoſe that are the Elect of God, and in time effectually called: for, though there be no ground to think that all to whom the Apoſtle writes were ſuch; Yet, becauſe he did intend to edifie the Elect and Regenerate, and in charity did eſteem them to be ſerious and conſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Truth, even in a ſuffering time, and to be aiming at an anſwerable walking thereunto, he calls them here, <hi>Elect, according to the foreknowledge of God.</hi> 3. Thoſe who are powerfully drawn to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and are changed by his Spirit, and have his Spirit preſent, manifeſting their change to be ſuch as the Word approves for ſaving, have a well grounded confidence of their election or effectual calling: for, thoſe whom the Apoſtle here calls, <hi>Elect, according to the foreknowledge of God,</hi> are afterward at large deſcribed to be ſuch as had a ſaving work of grace in them, to wit, ſaving faith in Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. ſome good degree of mortification, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and were daily imployers of Chriſt for growth in grace and holineſſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and had the Spirit of Jeſus reſting upon them, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.14. 4. The Lord doth not chooſe ſome ſinners from among others, whether in his eternal purpoſe of love, or in their effectual calling, becauſe he did foreſee them to make good uſe of their free-will, for converting or ſanctifying of themſelves; but only becauſe his Majeſty, having all perſons whom he purpoſed to frame unto ſalvation, under his all-ſeing eye, did out of his free love condeſcend upon ſome in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, while others were paſt by: for, thoſe here, who according to the foreknowledge of God, are choſen to ſalvation, are alſo choſen to come to the profeſſion of it through that which the Lords Spirit worketh in them: and ſo there can be nothing foreſeen in them to proceed from the right uſe of their free-will, which can be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to him to chooſe them, ſince their ſanctification is a work of his own Spirit, and they are not elected to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for it, but through it to ſalvation, as a mean of his own working <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Elect, according to the foreknowledge of God,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105751:7"/>
through ſanctification of the Spirit.</hi> 5. When we conſider the Lord in that act of chooſing ſome to eternal life, we ought to conſider him as a Father, both of Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and of all thoſe whom he doth elect: for, though Chriſt did not merit electing love, in regard that love moved God to give Chriſt for ſinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. yet we are allowed to conceive the Lord in that ſame act of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſome to everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, to be alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing his own Son to be their Redeemer, and to be the Purchaſer of that bleſſedneſſe for them; and ſo to be putting on a fatherly affection towards them in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. That which doth coſt us many thoughts, and which we do, in a manner, break in many pieces in our concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was but one eternal act of God, whoſe abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doth not admit of ſuch ſucceſſion in his thoughts or purpoſes, as he allows us to have in our thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe: for, while the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Election according to the foreknowledge of God, he calls him <hi>the Father.</hi> 6. All who are choſen to partake of that everlaſting bleſſedneſſe which Chriſt hath purchaſed, are appointed to come to the poſſeſſion of it through <hi>ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> whereby their minds are enlightened to ſee their woful condition by nature, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17, 18. to ſee the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility and excellency of a better eſtate, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17, 18. their hearts are powerfully inclined to cloſe with Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. and they are enabled to foreſake ſin, and follow after that which is well-pleaſing in the ſight of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.27. and ſo the whole man is ſeparated for the Lords uſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. which is ſanctification in a large ſenſe: for, theſe whom the Apoſtle affirms here to be elected to partake of what Chriſt hath purchaſed, he doth clearly intimate, that they muſt come to it <hi>through ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> 7. It is not in the power of mans free-will, or of any creature whatſoever, to work any good motion or inclination in a ſinners heart, (that is the work of the Spirit of God alone:) for, ſanctification which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all gracious qualities, is here called the work of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> 8. Jeſus Chriſt our Mediator hath both
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105751:8"/>
obeyed the Law perfectly for us, that he might make up the defects of our imperfect obedience, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. and caſt us a perfect copy, which we are bound to aim at in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. and likewiſe hath born all that wrath which was due to all the Elect for their breach of the Law, that ſo deſerved wrath might paſſe over all his redeemed ones, (as the deſtroying Angel paſſed by thoſe whoſe doors were ſprinkled with the bloud of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb, to which the Apoſtles expreſſion here alludes) for, both theſe, which are commonly called Chriſts active and paſſive obedience, are here expreſſed by the Apoſtle, while he ſaith, <hi>Elect, &amp;c. unto obedience, and ſprinkle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 9. All the Elect will certainly partake of all that Chriſt hath purchaſed by his doing and ſuffering for them; the firſt fruits whereof they get in time, and the full harveſt afterward: none of them can fall ſhort of what they are from eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated unto: for, the Apoſtle ſaith here, they are choſen <hi>unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the bloud of Christ,</hi> which is nothing elſe but to be choſen to lay hold on both by faith, and at laſt fully to enjoy what both hath merited for them. 10. Although Chriſts fulfilling of the Law, and ſuffering for our breach thereof, which is here called his <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>the sprinkling of his bloud,</hi> be in order firſt imputed to us for juſtification, before our ſanctification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Yet our aſſurance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our intereſt in his obedience and ſufferings, is not had till after our ſanctification, See <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. for, to be elect through ſanctification of the Spirit, unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſprinkling of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, is to be from eternity choſen to come by the way of holineſſe to the full participation of what Chriſt hath purchaſed by his obedience and ſufferings, to wit, peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt here, and the full enjoyment of God hereafter: both which are the purchaſe of his obedience and ſufferings, to which we are elected; <hi>Elect unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſprinkling.</hi> 11. When we conſider that great work which concerneth the ſalvation of loſt ſinners, we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105751:8"/>
are to look upon all the Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity as concurring therin, that ſo we may have the higher eſteem of the work, which hath ſuch agents, and may have our hearts raiſed to give equal glory to all the Perſons: for, though our Election, Redemption, Sanctification and Glorification, be each of them the work of the whole Deity, and none of the Perſons are to be excluded from any of theſe; Yet the Scripture alloweth us to have ſuch thoughts anent the order of the Perſons in working, as we may have anent the order of their ſubſiſtance: for, here the Apoſtle ſets forth the <hi>Father,</hi> out of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure electing ſinners to grace and glory; <hi>the Son,</hi> by his obedience and ſuffering, purchaſing the ſame for them; and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by his vertue and power, working grace in them, and ſo preparing them for that bleſſedneſſe, which the Father hath appointed, and Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for them: <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and sprinkling of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> From the ſalutation, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Miniſters of Chriſt, while they are dealing with the Lords People, ſhould labour for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged deſires after their welfare, ſo will they be the more ſerious and affectionate in dealing with them; their pains will be the more ſweet to themſelves, and the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to, and ſuccesful with, the people: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ordinarily begin their Epiſtles, with ſuch ample ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their deſires after the good of thoſe to whom they writ, as this Apoſtle doth here; <hi>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you.</hi> 2. No leſſe than a continual encreaſe of the proofs of Gods favour, and of all ſaving graces, together with true quietneſs of ſpirit, and every bleſſing of God neceſſary for the ſame, is the Lord's allowance to his redeemed and ſanctified ones: whatever meaſure of this allowance any of them have received, there is ſtill more of it to be had; and ſtill more of it will be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, except their unbelief, and other ſins obſtruct the outletting thereof: for, all this and much more the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle wiſheth unto them, and pronounceth upon them in

It is only thoſe who are fled to Chriſt's merits, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be changed by his Spirit, who can expect this comfortable allowance to be letten forth to them; and thoſe only Chriſt's Miniſters may in his Name certifie of it: for, it is only thoſe who are deſcribed in the former part of the Verſe, to whom this is ſpoken; and this is not only a favourable wiſh of the Apoſtles, but a definitive ſentence of the Spirit of God paſſed in their favours, That <hi>Grace and peace</hi> ſhall be <hi>multiplied unto them.</hi>

                  <p>Here the Apoſtle enters upon the firſt part of the Chapter, wherein he ſets forth the excellency of the ſtate of Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, that thereby he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in the Truth, comfort them under their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and inforce upon them the ſtudy of holineſſe, which are his principal ſcope in the whole Epiſtle: And this part he begins with a ſong of praiſe to God, which all Believers ſhould follow in their hearts: the reaſons of which ſong, contains their priviledges, whereof eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one doth prove their ſtate to be moſt excellent, and that therefore they ought to be conſtant ſufferers, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walkers. The firſt reaſon is, That they had a new ſpiritual life, and nature communicated to them in their Regeneration, whereby they were now made Children of God; and this priviledge is deſcribed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, 1. From the Author thereof, that it is God, and the Father of ſuch a Son as Chriſt, who hath made us his children. 2. From the impulſive cauſe moving him ſo to do, to wit, nothing in us, but mercy in him, which is commended from the plenty or abundance of it. 3. This priviledge of Regeneration is commended from the effect of it, that thereby the Regenerate are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105751:9"/>
made to hope for thoſe excellent things, ſpoken of in the following words. The nature of which hope is cleared, 1. From the propertie, or effect of it, it is lively, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſoul that hath it: And, 2. From the ground of it, which is the cauſe of its livelineſſe, to wit, that our Cautioner, who died in our room, is riſen to apply his purchaſe, and to poſſeſſe us in it. Hence we may <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The way to make Chriſtians ſtedfaſt in the Truth, chearful under their ſufferings for it, and thriving in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, is to have their hearts brought to a praiſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, from the conſideration of their ſpirituall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and the excellency of the ſtate of grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are, their hearts being thereby ſweetly diverted from ſad reflections upon their outward afflictions, and ſtrongly incouraged to hold on in the way of truth and holineſſe, notwithſtanding of all diſcouragements: for, the Apoſtle's ſcope being to confirm and comfort ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and to provoke them to the ſtudy of holineſſe, he labours firſt of all to engage their hearts to this exerciſe of praiſe, by raiſing this Pſalm before them, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father,</hi> &amp;c. 2. They are fitteſt to chear up the hearts of others to ſpirituall joy and praiſe, who have their own hearts kept ſo ſenſible of the excellent ſtate of Believers, becauſe of their ſpirituall priviledges, that they are ready to burſt forth in the praiſes of God themſelves, and go before others in that exerciſe, as they have a calling and opportunity: for, the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to comfort thoſe heavy hearted exiles under their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and provoke them to praiſe, hath his own heart ſo full, that he muſt break forth in ſinging before them, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Our praiſe, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, is not any addition of bleſſedneſſe to him, who is in that reſpect eſpecially, above all bleſſing and praiſe, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.5. but it is only our acknowledgment of his praiſe-worthy perfections, and of his goodneſſe to ſinners, that they may fall in love with him, and joyn with us in the ſame acknowledgment: for, that word, which is tranſlated, <hi>Bleſſing of God,</hi> in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105751:10"/>
ſignifies to ſpeak well of him. 4. Of all the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall priviledges beſtowed upon ſinners in time, which call them to joy and praiſe, the firſt and principall, is their Regeneration, whereby they who are dead in ſins, and treſpaſſes, and born heirs of Gods curſe, have a new life communicated to them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 3. and ſuch heavenly qualities ſtamped upon their ſoul, as makes them in ſome meaſure reſemble their heavenly Father, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. for, the Apoſtle puts our Regeneration for the firſt reaſon of this ſong, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath begotten us again.</hi> 5. This change of a ſinners nature, which is made in Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the alone work of the omnipotent God, as the principall and efficient cauſe, wherein he makes uſe of men as inſtruments in his hand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. and of the Word from them as his means, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more power in man, naturally to work this change in himſelf, than can be imagined in any man to have begotten himſelf: Therefore is it ſet forth here by ſuch a word as may lead all the Regenerate to conſider themſelves as wholly paſſive when firſt this change is made upon them: <hi>Bleſſed be the God, &amp;c. who hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us again.</hi> 6. It doth exceedingly commend the free love of God in making this change upon ſinners, and may much highten in their hearts the eſteem of his work, that He, who hath ſuch a Son as Jeſus Chriſt, who was, and is his peer and equal, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6. the expreſs Image of his Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and his full delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. ſhould have vouchſafed upon ſuch unworthy things as we are, ſo ſweet and honourable a relation to himſelf, and that bleſſed Son of his, as is imported in this his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of us again! the eſteem whereof the Apoſtle heightens in his own heart, and in the hearts of the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate by this, That it is <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath begotten us again.</hi> 7. The Lord is not moved to beſtow his grace upon ſinners, by any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which he did foreſee or find in them, ſeing none can give firſt to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. nor be profitable to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105751:10"/>
him, <hi>Job</hi> 22.2. who needeth nothing from any, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25. but only by his own mercy, which is that lovely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty whereby he is ſtrongly inclined to let out of his goodneſſe to unworthy and miſerable ſinners, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the contrary from him: for, here <hi>Mercy</hi> is made the alone and ſufficient motive of our regeneration, while the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>According to his mercy he hath begotten us.</hi> 8. That mercy which moves the Lord to work a ſaving change upon any ſinner, is both very plentiful for the quantity of it, and moſt excellent for the quality of it, and it muſt be ſo, there being ſo many provocations found and foreſeen in ſinners, which only plentiful mercy can overcome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.8. and ſo many excellent favours to be beſtowed upon the Regenerate as never entered in their hearts to conceive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. that it muſt be excellent mercy that doth beſtow them. Therefore, that which moves the Lord to regenerate ſinners, is not ſimply cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mercy,</hi> but <hi>abundant mercy,</hi> which in the Original ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, not only the plenty of it for quantity, but alſo the excellency and worth of it for quality. 9. The Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate come not preſently to the poſſeſſion of what Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, they muſt be firſt tryed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will glorifie him, by living in the confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of what he hath purchaſed and promiſed, which is <hi>hope</hi> flowing from <hi>faith,</hi> and only differing from it in this, that <hi>faith</hi> apprehends the thing promiſed as if it were preſent, ſo giving it a ſpiritual kind of ſubſiſtance in the ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. and <hi>hope</hi> makes the heart, with ſome meaſure of chearfull patience, expect that good which it looks upon as abſent for the time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. for, the want of poſſeſſion for a time after regeneration, is imported in this, that we are <hi>begotten again unto a lively hope.</hi> 10. Before the Lord make this powerful change upon ſinners in regeneration, they are altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any true and well-grounded hope of a better life than this, what-ever ſtrong and groundleſſe preſumptions thereof they may entertain: for, ſo much is ſuppoſed in this, that we are <hi>begotten again unto a lively hope.</hi> 11.

                  <p>In this and the two following Verſes, is contained the laſt reaſon of the joy and conſtancy of Believers under their ſufferings, (which might be branched out in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arguments to that purpoſe;) the ſum whereof is, That all the Prophets and Apoſtles; yea, the very Angels of Heaven, are Condiſciples and fellow-ſtudents of this way of ſalvation which the Goſpel holds forth: and therefore it is worthy to be rejoyced in, even under ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for it. This tenth Verſe holds forth how accurate and ſerious ſearchers in the nature of this ſalvation; held forth in the Goſpel, the Prophets were, who did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of a more clear manifeſtation of the Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning is, and of a more plentifull out-letting of the graces of the Spirit upon thoſe who live after Chriſt's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, than had been upon thoſe who lived before: and this may be taken for an argument by it ſelf, to move thoſe upon whom that grace is beſtowed, chearfully to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105751:13"/>
adhere to the Goſpel, notwithſtanding of ſufferings for it. Hence, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The way of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, which is held forth in the New Teſtament, is no new light broken up ſince Chriſts dayes in the fleſh; but is the very ſame in ſubſtance, which was known to the Prophets under the Old Teſtament, and by them made known to the Church then: although the doctrine of ſalvation be now clearer, and the gifts and graces of the Spirit more plentifully diſpenſed, ſince the price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is actually paid, for which, God gave out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt grace and glory to the Elect before; yet the way of ſalvation then, and now, is one and the ſame, for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for, of that ſalvation, which Believers in Chriſt do by Faith now under the Goſpel receive, the Apoſtle here ſpeaks: <hi>Of which ſalvation the Prophets have enquired, &amp;c.</hi> 2. So ſweet and raviſhing a ſtudy is that way of ſalvation through Chriſt incarnate, that the more knowledg therof any attain unto; they will ſtill be the more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive and diligent after a further meaſure of it; ſo that thoſe can know nothing of Chriſt ſavingly, who ſatisfie themſelves with any meaſure of the knowledge of Him, that they have already attained unto: for, even the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, after ſome inſight in that way, partly, by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate revelation, and partly, by their former diligence, were not taken off from the painfull uſe of ordinary means; ſuch as Reading, Meditation, Prayer, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prying, into the meaning of thoſe manifold Types, which held forth that way of ſalvation through the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah to come, and the benefits which the Redeemed have by Him; but did renew and double their diligence, as is imported by the ſeveral words here to one purpoſe; <hi>Of which ſalvation the Prophets have enquired, and ſearched diligently.</hi> 3. All that deliver the mind of God to His People, ought to be affectionate and ſerious ſtudents of it themſelves, that ſo they may make the Truths they are to deliver, their own, and have their hearts affected therewith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1. So may they expect it ſhall be more bleſt to take impreſſion, and have effects upon the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105751:13"/>
hearers: for, the words here, expreſſing the Prophets pains in the ſtudy of that way of ſalvation through Chriſt, do import, that never did Hunters with greater ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs and delight purſue their game, nor thoſe that dig in the earth, where they know ſome rich treaſure is to be had, more ſeriouſly apply themſelves to that exerciſe, than the Prophets did inſiſt upon this ſtudy; <hi>Of which ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Prophets have enquired, and ſearched diligently, who propheſied before.</hi> 4. The prime ſubject both of the Old and New Teſtament, whereupon all the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould inſiſt with His People, is the free grace of God, manifeſted in giving Chriſt for ſinners, in his powerfull drawing of their hearts to cloſe with him, for pardoning grace, and for renewing of their natures by inherent grace; and ſo obliging and enabling them to walk worthy of that grace of God: for, the ſum of the Prophets work (in which the Apoſtles concur, as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words do make clear) was, <hi>to propheſie of the grace that ſhould come unto us.</hi> 5. Although this grace was made known, and communicated to them who lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts incarnation, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. Yet it is in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner come unto thoſe who live after, in regard of a clearer manifeſtation of the Doctrine of Gods Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. a more plentifull communication of the gifts and graces of his Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.16. and that both of theſe are extended to ſome of all Nations, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. In which reſpects it is here called, <hi>The grace come unto us.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle clears yet further the Prophets pains in the ſtudy of that way of ſalvation through Chriſt incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſhewing that they were exceeding deſirous and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to have known the particular time of his coming in the fleſh, and to have known more clearly than they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105751:14"/>
did, how happy thoſe times behoved to be, whereof the Spirit of Chriſt (who was even then in an extraordinary way preſent with them) did mean, when he moved them to deſcribe, ſo long beforehand, the humiliation, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Meſſiah; and his exaltation, or the glorious effects that were to follow upon his ſufferings, to himſelf, and his redeemed ones: therefore they who lived after his incarnation, ought chearfully and conſtantly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Goſpel, notwithſtanding of all their ſufferings. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the way which the Lord uſually keeps with the deareſt of his Servants, to let out his mind to them by little and little, to make plain ſome things to them, and keep up other things from them, that he may humble them, quicken them to diligence, and keep up correſpondence betwixt himſelf and them: for, though it was made clear to the Prophets, that Chriſt was to be incarnate, that much grace ſhould be in his dayes, and more bleſſed times, than any they had ſeen; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all of them had ſome intimation of the time of his incarnation, by <hi>Jacob's</hi> propheſie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. and thoſe of them who lived after the Captivity, by <hi>Daniel's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. Yet they were kept dark concerning the particular time when he ſhould come, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct quality of His times, what form of Worſhip, and way of adminiſtration of Goſpel-Ordinances there ſhould be then; Therefore are they here ſet forth, <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them did ſignifie, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The holy Spirit is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſubſiſting, diſtinct from the Father and the Son, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from both, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. and true God, equal to both, to whom future events are known as if they were actually exiſting: for, here he is called the Spirit of Chriſt, and is ſaid to <hi>teſtifie beforehand the ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi> 3. Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond perſon of the Trinity hath been before his incarnation actually exerciſing the Office of Mediatorſhip, revealing to the Church, in all ages, the way of ſalvation through his ſufferings: for, it was the Spirit of the Son of God that dwelt in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105751:14"/>
Prophets, and made known to them thoſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Mediator, whereof they did propheſie: <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt in them teſtified beforehand.</hi> 4. The chief things which the Spirit of Chriſt did manifeſt to the Prophets, and wherewith their prime ſtudy was taken up, was the ſufferings of the Mediator, and the glory that ſhould follow thereupon to him and his redeemed ones; it being the end of all the diſcoveries of ſin, and threatnings of wrath that are in the Law, to point out the neceſſity of his ſatisfaction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. and the very ſubſtance and ſignification of all the Types and Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This method was kept with Chriſt the head, and none of his members ſhould expect to have it changed with them, that he was firſt to ſuffer, and then glory was to follow; So that the Jews have no warrant from any thing in the Prophets to expect a Meſſiah in worldly glory without ſuffering: for, this is the compend of all that the Prophets ſpoke of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, at the direction of his Spirit in them, <hi>They teſtified beforehand of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the glory that ſhould follow.</hi>

                  <p>That the Apoſtle may yet further commend the truths of the Goſpell, as worthy to be rejoyced in, and ſuffered for; and may prove the ſtate of Believers now, to be in ſome reſpects more excellent than that of the ancient Prophets, he ſheweth, 1. what ſucceſſe the Prophets
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105751:15"/>
had of their pains: although they got not the very thing they did ſo much deſire, which was, not only to have known the time of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, but to have lived to ſee it, as is clear by comparing the former Verſe, with <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.24. Yet the Lord condeſcended to give them ſuch an anſwer of their pains as might quiet their hearts, to wit, that they themſelves were not to ſee the temporal accompliſhment of their own Prophecies; that was reſerved for them who were to live after Chriſts incarnation: 2. He ſheweth, that what the Prophets had foretold, was now much cleared to the Chriſtian Church by the Apoſtles, who were for that end endued with an extraordinary meaſure of the holy Spirit, ſent down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the day of Pentecoſt. And, 3. he affirmeth, that this way of ſalvation through Chriſt already incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as it is now cleared and adminiſtred under the Goſpel, is ſo raviſhing a ſubject, that it takes up the delight and ſtudy of the Angels of Heaven to pry in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Every one of which doth infer that concluſion, which is to be underſtood as the Apoſtles ſcope, That therefore Believers now ought chearfully to adhere to the truths of the Goſpel, what ever they may ſuffer for ſo doing. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although the Lord do not alwayes anſwer the approven pains of his Servants with deſired ſatisfaction, in the particular that they aim at; Yet it is not his way to leave them without ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and fruit of their pains, as ſhall be more for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, their true good, and the good of others alſo, than if they had received that ſatisfaction which they ſo much deſired: for, though the Prophets (who were approven in their ſearch after the time of Chriſts manifeſtation in the fleſh, there being ſomewhat concerning it revealed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. and there being no-where a diſcharge of enquiry after that time, as there is after the time of Chriſts ſecond coming, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.36. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.1.) got not their deſired ſatisfaction either by ſeeing, or knowing particularly the time of Chriſts incarnation; Yet they were not left without an anſwer from their Maſter, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105751:15"/>
had as much of his mind manifeſted to them, as might quiet their minds; <hi>Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter.</hi> 2. It ought to be no diſcouragement to Chriſts Servants, that he put them to much pains in his ſervice, for the good of others, withholding from them in the mean time, that meaſure of ſatisfaction which he minds to beſtow upon others by their pains; it being a ſufficient encouragement to any of his Servants or People, to know that he honours them to ſerve Him acceptably, and that He will make up all their preſent loſſe, when He and they meets: for, to the Prophets, who were very laborious, and aſſiduous, as the Bees, who make ſweet Honey for others, and taſt but ſparingly of it themſelves, <hi>It was revealed</hi> (as a ſufficient reward of all their pains) <hi>that not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter.</hi> 3. Although the fruit of Chriſts death hath ever been, ſince the beginning of the world, forthcoming for the ſalvation and comfort of the Elect, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. Yet the advantage of thoſe who live after His incarnation, is, in ſome reſpects, greater than theirs who lived before: and that (beſides other reaſons) becauſe the truth of things revealed then, is now more evident to thoſe who may compare Prophecies with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment: for, it is here ſet down, as ſome piece of diſadvantage to the Prophets, That, <hi>not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter the things.</hi> 4. There is a compleat harmony betwixt the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, what ever ſeeming contradiction may be apprehended by blind minds to be betwixt them: for, the Apoſtle affirms here, that the Prophets did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſame things, <hi>which are now reported by them that have preached the Gospel.</hi> 5. To make the Truth lovely to us, and to confirm us in adhering to it under ſufferings. It is neceſſary that the Spirit of Jeſus be acknowledged to be with the Meſſenger, making known to him the Truth, and enabling him to deliver it: although the way of the Spirits preſence with, and aſſiſtance of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Meſſengers, was different from his way with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105751:16"/>
ordinary Miniſters; Yet, if it was neceſſary to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, in order to peoples profiting by the one, it is much more neceſſary for their profiting by the other: Therefore, to make the doctrine of the Goſpel lovely to people, and to confirm them in adhering to it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſufferings, the Apoſtle ſaith, That the ſame things which the Spirit of Chriſt did ſignifie to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, were reported by them that preached the Goſpel to them, <hi>with the holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven.</hi> 6. Although the glorified Angels can have no ſuch deſires as have any painfull unſatisfaction with them, ſeing they live in the bleſſed viſion and conſtant fruition of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. Yet ſo excellent and raviſhing a myſterie is this plot of the ſalvation of loſt ſinners through Chriſt incarnate, which the Goſpel manifeſts, that they are no leſs humble and accurate ſtudents of it, and no leſſe ſeriouſly taken up with the contemplation of the way of God's reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Himſelf to ſinners, and keeping familiar correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them, in the man Chriſt, than if they had ſuch deſires; as is imported in this word in the Original, which hath in it an alluſion to the type of the two Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims that were upon the Ark, looking down into the Mercy-ſeat: <hi>Which things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> 7. The moe atteſters of the truths of the Goſpel we have, the more worthy thoſe have been, and the more taken up with the ſtudy thereof, The more are we obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and adhere to the ſame, notwithſtanding of all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: if we ſlight ſo great a ſalvation, or faint in our adherance to the Goſpel revealing it, for any poſſible ſufferings from men, great muſt our judgment be; many witneſſes may be brought forth againſt us in the day of the Lord, even this cloud of witneſſes, all the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and the Angels of Heaven, who have with ſuch harmony and earneſtneſs delighted in this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for, this is the force of the Apoſtles principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this and the two preceding Verſes, which might be branched out in many pertinent arguments, to preſſe chearful ſuffering for the truth of the Goſpel, That the

                  <p>In this ſecond part of the Chapter, the Apoſtle draws from his former doctrine, concerning the excellent ſtate, and rich priviledges of Believers, ſeveral exhortations to the ſtudy of holineſſe, and preſſeth the ſame by ſeverall motives. The firſt exhortation is, That they would draw up their affections (which are here called the loyns of the mind, becauſe they follow the motions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) from things below, and unite them together upon Jeſus Chriſt, and their ſpiritual and eternal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſpoken of before. The ſecond is, That they would ſtudy ſobriety; which is not only to keep themſelves free of unlawfull pleaſures, but mainly to meddle ſparingly with lawfull delights. The third is, That they would live conſtantly in the believing expectation of that full manifeſtation of Gods favour, and that perfection in holineſſe, which Chriſt will bring with him to his own, at his laſt appearance: And all theſe the Apoſtle doth preſs by the conſideration of thoſe priviledges of believers formerly mentioned, as the firſt motive, comprehenſive of many others. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The conſideration of our ſpiritual priviledges by Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould ſtir us up to the ſtudy of holineſſe; our diligence in that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being the means of our perſeverance, and that which clears our right to take the comfort of thoſe priviledges, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. So that what ever matter of joy and praiſe Believers have, it ſhould be turned by them in motives to the duties of holineſs; and therefore they can have no true comfort in their ſpiritual priviledges, who are, by the apprehenſion of them, caſt over in ſecurity, and not quickned to their duty: for, the Apoſtle (having in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105751:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the former part of the Chapter held forth many grounds of joy and praiſe to Believers, under all their ſufferings, from their election, regeneration, their right to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance, the certainty of their perſeverance, and other priviledges) doth teach them here to turn all theſe in motives to holineſs, while he infers from them, theſe, and the following exhortations, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gird up the loyns of your mind, be ſober, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Till the Heirs of Glory be poſſeſſed in their inheritance, they ſhould ſtill think with themſelves, that much of their way and work, and many difficulties are yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the poſſeſſion thereof, that ſo they may be kept from ſecurity and defection, and may be ſtill fitting themſelves for their journey, and their warfare: for, this ancient cuſtom of truſſing up long garments, whence the word here is borrowed, was eſpecially uſed when they were to journey, or run a race, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.29.18.46. or when they were to fight, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Gird up the loyns of your mind.</hi> 3. The affections of the Children of the Lord are oftentimes low and ſcattered, partly, while they are ſinking under ſinfull diſcouragement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5. and partly, while they are divided, and ſpent upon baſe and ſinfull objects, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.36, 37. both which, as main hinderances of Chriſtians in their courſe toward their heavenly inheritance, are ſupponed in this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be their too ordinary temper; <hi>Gird up the loyns of your mind.</hi> 4. It ſhould be the great ſtudy of thoſe who mind their ſpiritual journey and warfare, to get their affections elevated above things earthly, united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon Jeſus Chriſt, (See <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11.) and taken up with their priviledges by Him, and the duties their priviledges calls them to; otherwiſe they can no more make progreſs in their chriſtian courſe, than a man whoſe garments are about his feet can run or fight: <hi>Wherefore gird up the loyns of your mind.</hi> 5. They that would keep up their affections from diſcouragement, or ſetling upon things earthly, would labour to have their minds upward, the notions and diſcourſes thereof, (as the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105751:17"/>
word here tranſlated, <hi>the mind,</hi> ſignifies) taken up with things ſpiritual and heavenly, becauſe the affections do follow and depend upon the motions of the mind or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; for which cauſe, they are here called the <hi>loyns of the mind:</hi> Therefore, the Apoſtle, having in the former part laboured to draw up their minds to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of their ſpiritual and eternal priviledges, he here exhorts to draw up and unite upon theſe their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: <hi>Gird up the loyns of your mind.</hi> 6. They that would make progreſs in their journey toward their heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, muſt ſtudy ſobriety, which conſiſts in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the rage and exceſs of carnal paſſions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.35. in the entertaining and expreſſing a mean eſteem of our ſelves, and a high eſteem of the leaſt good in others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. in a prudent warineſs to meddle with, or vent our opinion of things above our reach or calling, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.25. in a ſpare medling with all ſenſible delights, though lawful in themſelves; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs whereof no leſſe indiſpoſeth Chriſtians for ſpirituall performances, than exceſſe of meat or drink doth a man for his work or journey, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. and in a holy and ſtrict watchfulneſs, (as the word in the Original alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) leſt we offend any of theſe wayes: for, as all the reſt of the exhortations here, are given to fit Believers for their journey toward their fair inheritance formerly deſcribed, ſo is this, <hi>Be ſober.</hi> 7. Even thoſe for whom the heavenly inheritance is made ſure, and who have attained to ſome comfortable meaſure of aſſurance, that they ſhall poſſeſs it, have need to be ſtirred up to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of perſeverance in grace and holineſs; eſpecially, to keep their hearts ſtill up in the confident expectation of that bleſſedneſs which Faith cloſeth with in the promiſe, which is the exerciſe of the grace of hope; and to live ſo, as they may never mar that confidence, whether by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, or diſcouragement, knowing that when we loſe our confidence, we do therewith loſe our ſtrength for all duties, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.18. for, oven thoſe, for whom the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance is made ſure, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. whoſe perſeverance

That which ſtrengthens the Believers hope of Glory, and keeps it in life and exerciſe, is the believing conſideration of that compleat ranſom paid by Chriſt, for them that fly to him, his undertaking to cauſe them perſevere, and their own frequent reflecting upon the evidences of his grace in themſelves: for, upon theſe grounds, held forth in the former part of the Chapter, doth the Apoſtle infer this exhortation, <hi>Wherefore gird <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here is the ſecond motive to the ſtudy of holineſſe, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that ſweet priviledge of adoption: by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, the Apoſtle excites them, as children, to give themſelves up to their fathers obedience, and to keep themſelves free of the ſlavery of their luſts, wherein they had lived before they knew Chriſt ſavingly. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although the beſt that ever lived have reaſon to judge themſelves unworthy to be in the rank of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

to the Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. Yet it pleaſes Him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the meaneſt that receive Chriſt by Faith, to the dignity and priviledges of His Children: for, the Apoſtle deſigns all Believers, even the meaneſt, by this ſtile, <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Children.</hi> 2. Whenever the Children of the Lord do conſider their dignity of ſonſhip, they ſhould be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtrongly moved to the ſtudy of obedience to their Father: which conſiſts in a ſincere endeavour after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to all his Commands, without exception of any, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. in their kindly ſubmiſſion to all his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. and both theſe out of love to Him, a now become their Father in Chriſt: So ſhall their ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be clearly evidenced to them, when they devote themſelves wholly to their Fathers obedience, and go about every part of it, <hi>as obedient children,</hi> 3. The faith of this bleſſed relation to God as our Father in Chriſt, is that frame of ſpirit wherewith we ſhould labour to go about every duty of new obedience; ſo will we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that our infirmities ſhall be pitied, and our weak endeavours to obey, accepted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. and that our wants ſhall be ſupplied as ſhall be neceſſary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.32. for, as theſe words contain a motive to obedience, taken from our adoption; ſo, they hold forth the right manner of Childrens going about every duty, to wit, <hi>As obedient Children,</hi> in obedience, and out of love to their Father. 4. Before that ſaving change, which the Lord makes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinners in Regeneration, they are not only void of the ſaving knowledge of God in Chriſt, but they are alſo, (as the word here doth ſignifie) incapable, and without a mind to know any thing of that ſort: for, this is one part, and the firſt part of that miſery wherein theſe who are now Children of God, are ſupponed to have been; <hi>in ignorance.</hi> 5. Ignorance is the fountain and root of profanity, and of folks ſerving of their luſts: they who know not the terror and ſweetneſſe of the Lord, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be deterred, nor drawn from delighting in the ſlavery of their ſins: for, the Apoſtle makes their ignorance, the riſe of their profanity, while he dehorts them from <hi>faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105751:19"/>
themſelves according to their former luſts, in ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 6. Not only are the unregenerate in ignorance, and therefore ſlaves to their luſts; but they are voluntary ſlaves, giving themſelves wholly away to the ſatisfaction of their ſinful deſires, and ſhaping, or moulding (as the word here ſignifies) their endeavours and undertakings, according to the ſinfull motions of their corrupt nature: for, ſo were thoſe once, who are now Children, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living in ignorance, and following their luſts, but <hi>faſhioning themſelves according to their luſts.</hi> 7. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Children of the Lord to have a clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the wofull caſe wherein they were before Chriſt did change them, that they may be kept ſtill humble, and careful to teſtifie their thankfulneſs to Him, for making a change upon them, in all the duties of new obedience, whereby He is honoured: for, while the Apoſtle is preſſing theſe duties, he giveth this clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of that woful condition wherein they had been formerly, <hi>faſhioning themſelves according to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer luſts, in their ignorance.</hi> 8. Although there be no hazard, that any of the Regenerate ſhall ever loſe their new nature, which is the ſeed of God abiding in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. Yet, in regard their former luſts are but in part ſubdued, and therefore old love to them is ſoon kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, there is a great hazard that they ſhould become, for their preſent diſpoſition and carriage, very like unto what they were before they got a new nature: the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, ſhould ſtir them up to diligence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in the ſtudy of mortification: for, this hazard is inſinuated by the Apoſtle, while he preſſeth upon the Regenerate, that they ſhould not <hi>faſhion themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their former luſts, in their ignorance.</hi> 9.

                  <p>The Apoſtle, having in the former Verſe preſſed the ſtudy of holineſs negatively, from that great priviledge of adoption, doth here preſſe the ſame poſitively, by two further motives: The one is, That ſince the Lord had vouchſafed to call them from an eſtate of ſin and wrath, to a ſtate of holineſſe and happineſs, they ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to walk anſwerably to their holy calling. The other is, That there ſhould be a conformity between the Holy Lord, and all His Children, and therefore holineſs, which is His property ought to be ſtudied by them, and manifeſted in all the particular paſſages of their chriſtian courſe: And this laſt argument, the Apoſtle confirms from the Scripture, whereof though there be no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place here cited, yet the ſubſtance of the words are to be found in ſeveral places, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.44.19.2. and 20.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. They that would prove themſelves to be truly holy, and ſo to be the Children of the Lord, muſt not ſatisfie themſelves with the negative part of holineſs, which conſiſts in abſtenance from what is unſuitable to the relation of Children; but they muſt alſo labour for the poſitive part of it, which conſiſts in ſome meaſure of conformity to their heavenly Father in His holineſſe: for, after the Apoſtle hath preſt that ſtudy negatively, that they ſhould not conform themſelves to their former luſts, in their ignorance, he urgeth here the poſitive part thereof, <hi>But as he which hath called you is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo be ye holy.</hi> 2. They who have found the Lord powerfully calling them, from that eſtate of ſin and wrath, wherein they are naturally, to a bleſſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace and happineſs, ſhould think themſelves thereby ſtrongly obliged to the ſtudy of holineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſtians in heart and practiſe, are alienated and drawn from things earthly, and are ſet apart for the uſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105751:20"/>
of their Lord, and ſo do evidence to themſelves their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. for, as a motive to the ſtudy of holineſs, the Apoſtle here ſuggeſts to Believers their calling; <hi>But as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy.</hi> 3. Although it be altogether impoſſible for any Man or Angel to be conform in holineſſe unto God, who is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially immutable, and infinitly holy, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. Yet there is no abſolute unerring patern, lower than the holy One, to be ſet before the eyes of the Children of the Lord, who ought not to make the holieſt on earth a ſufficient copie to them; but, being ſtill aſhamed of their defects in holineſs, and unſatisfied with their preſent meaſure thereof, muſt ſtill be aiming at a nearer conformity with Chriſt the Lord, and daily making uſe of Him, who is their ſanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. to cover their defects, and to ſanctifie them more fully: for, this is the example and patern of that holineſſe to which all the called Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſhould aſpire; <hi>As he who hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy.</hi> 4. Although internal holineſſe be mainly lovely to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6. and the external, without it, be loathſom to Him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.27. Yet none ſhould ſatisfie themſelves with that holineſſe, which they imagine to have within, but ſhould labour to manifeſt holineſs in their external converſation, by ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in their viſible actings, mindful and reſpective of all the Commands of God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. whereby they glorifie Him before others, and evidence themſelves to have true holineſſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. for, this conformity to our Father in holineſſe, muſt be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in the converſation.</hi> 5. There is no part of a Chriſtian's converſation, which ought not to favour of holineſs and true piety; not only his religious, but even his common and civil actions, ought to be done in the Lord, and for his glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. And under all the various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God with him, he ought ſtill to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a hater of ſin, and a lover of what the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, which is the thing here preſſed, <hi>to be holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> 6. The ſtricteſt of moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105751:20"/>
in the Old Teſtament, are binding to Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New; the ſubſtance of all of them, which is, That reaſonable creatures ſhould love their Maker and their fellow-creatures, being of perpetual equity, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging both Angels and Men, and nothing being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us, in any of them, to be done by vertue of our own ſtrength, or that we may be juſtified thereby, but only what the Regenerate are enabled to aim at, and to attain to ſuch a meaſure of, as through Chriſt ſhall be accepted, as if they had attained to what is required, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. for, here one of the ſtricteſt of moral precepts that are in the Old Teſtament, is preſſed upon Believers; <hi>As he who hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy; for it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> 7. The Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, ought to have His Word ſo richly dwelling in them, that they may be able to confirm what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to the Lords People, from clear and expreſſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies thereof, eſpecially when they preſſe ſuch Truths as natural hearts are moſt averſe from: for, even this extraordinary Miniſter, the Apoſtle, whom people had leſſe reaſon to ſuſpect than any ordinary Miniſter, while he preſſeth this high pitch of holineſſe, to wit, the ſtudy of conformity to the Holy One, he thus confirms his doctrine by Scripture, <hi>Becauſe it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> 8. Although it be the duty of Miniſters, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to point out to people the particular place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, whereby they do confirm their doctrine, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33. yet ought the Lords People to be ſo well acquainted with the written Word, that upon the hearing of any ſentence of it, they may acknowledge it to be the Lords mind, that ſo there may be no neceſſity for Miniſters to ſpend time, and burthen peoples memories with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied citations for every Truth they deliver; eſpecially, where the words of Scripture are remarkable, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be found: for, ſo the Apoſtle citing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Scripture, which is frequently to be found in the Old Teſtament, doth not name any particular place, but only ſaith, <hi>It is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi>

                  <p>Follows the fifth and ſixth motives to the ſtudy of holineſs: The one is, That even thoſe who take the Lord for their Father, and themſelves for his Children, will find Him an exact and impartial Judge of them, and all their actions. The other is, That His Children are but ſtrangers and ſojourners, and ſo living in the midſt of many hazards and temptations; both which ſhould move them to ſtudy holineſs, whereof this is a ſpecial part, to carry along in their hearts, through their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, ſome fear of offending their heavenly Father, who is to be their Judge. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The more acquaintance with the Lord, and confidence of His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection Chriſtians attain unto, the more are they obliged to the ſtudy of holineſs; and particularly, to walk in fear of offending Him, who will be ſanctified in all that draw nigh unto Him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. and will have every one that names Him their own God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to depart from iniquity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. for, ſo doth the Apoſtle reaſon here; <hi>If ye call on the Father,</hi> (or, if ye name Him Father) <hi>paſſe the time of your ſojourning in fear.</hi> 2. As thoſe who may call God their Father, will not want their own preſſing neceſſities, which will put them to cry to Him, as men do in greateſt extremities (as the word here ſignifies;) So under the greateſt of theſe, they ſhould ſtill maintain the faith of that ſtanding relation betwixt Him and them, and deal with Him in earneſtneſs, and confidence of His help, as with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is imported in this, <hi>If ye call on the Father.</hi> 3. While we take up the Lord under this ſweet relation of a Father to us in Chriſt, which may beget in our hearts familiarity with Him, and confidence of obtaining ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary help from Him, we ought alſo to cheriſh other conſiderations of Him, and look upon Him as ſtanding
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105751:21"/>
in other relations to us, eſpecially, that of a Judge, that ſo our hearts may be kept in awe, and fear of offending Him, and our homlineſs may not mar our reverence: for, the Apoſtle holdeth forth both theſe relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Lord and his Children, to be joyntly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them; <hi>If ye call on the Father, who without respect of perſons judgeth.</hi> 4. The Lord is both an impartial Judge, who cannot be byaſſed either with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any benefit, or terrified by the apprehenſion of any hazard from creatures, <hi>Job</hi> 35.7, 8. and likewiſe ſo exact in judging, that neither perſon, nor action, can eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape his judgment: for, <hi>without reſpect of perſons he judgeth according to every mans work,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. 5. There will be no exerciſe of mercy (as it is taken for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of ſin not formerly pardoned) at the laſt reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: thoſe that are in Chriſt, ſhall be judged according to His obedience and works, which will be reckoned theirs, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.9. and their good works, done in His ſtrength, only remembred, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. As for thoſe who never fled to Him, they ſhall be judged according to the ſtricteſt rigor of the Law of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 8, 9. for, the Apoſtle looks mainly to the laſt judgment, while he ſaith, <hi>He judgeth every man according to his works.</hi> 6. The Children of the Lord, are pilgrims and ſtrangers in this world, and ſhould eſteem themſelves to be ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. and therefore ſhould live in fear of ſnares and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, as the Apoſtle here preſſeth, never imitating the faſhions of this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. ſatisfying themſelves with ſuch ſober entertainment, as Gods providence brings to their hand upon their journey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. and ſtill haſtning toward their Country, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35. for, ſo much doth the Apoſtle import, while he thus expreſſeth our condition here, <hi>The time of our ſojourning.</hi> 7. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they that are fled to Chriſt, ought never to fear any hazard from fleſh, which may diſcourage them in the way of their duty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. nor yet eternal wrath, further than to ſtir them up to renew their flight to Him, and to engage them to His ſervice, who hath delivered
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105751:22"/>
them from it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Yet ſuch a fear of offending their Father, (flowing from the conſideration of His excellency, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.6, 7. and of His goodneſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. as makes them watchfull againſt temptations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their own weakneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. and quickens them to their duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28.) ſhould be carried along in their hearts thorow their whole time, and cheriſhed by the conſideration of thoſe relations they have to God as a Father, and a Judge; <hi>If ye call on the Father, who without respect of perſons judgeth, &amp;c. paſſe the time of your ſojourning here in fear.</hi>

                  <p>Here is the ſeventh motive to the ſtudy of holineſs, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that great priviledge of our Redemption, which is here deſcribed, 1. From the price thereof; and this the Apoſtle expreſſeth negatively, that it was not ſo baſe as the beſt of corruptible things; ſuch as have ſometimes ranſomed the greateſt of men from outward bondage, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.14, 15. and poſitively, that it was the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious bloud of the innocent Son of God, who was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by the Paſchal Lamb, which behoved to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.5. 2. This work of Redemption, is deſcribed from the effect of it toward the Chriſtian Church, and Believers in it, to wit, That they were therby delivered from that legal diſpenſation which was altogether unprofitable, as the obſervance thereof had been preſt upon them by many of their fathers; and from every other ſinful courſe, wherein they had been harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their fathers example and precepts: So the ſum of this argument is, that ſince they themſelves did take it for granted, that they were bought with ſo excellent a price, from ſo woful a condition, they ought therefore to live
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105751:22"/>
to the honour of their Redeemer in the ſtudy of holineſs. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. All that are redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt, were once ſlaves, and in bondage to Satan, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to their own luſts, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. and ſo under ſubjection to the wrath of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. for, <hi>Redemption</hi> ſuppones captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and bondage. 2. There could be no freedom of ſinners from this bondage, but by the paying of a price to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Juſtice: Gods mercy could not be beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſinners (the Covenant of works being once made) but with the ſafety and ſatisfaction of His Juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. which could not have been, except the price had been paid which Juſtice did require: for, <hi>Redemption</hi> ſuppones alſo the paying of a price. 3. Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, are by Him brought to a ſtate of liberty and freedom, not from their obedience to His holy Law, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. but from any right Satan had over them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their believing in Him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and from the dominion and ſlavery of ſin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. And the whole Church under the New Teſtament, is by Him delivered from the yoke of Moſaical Ceremonies, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. for, this priviledge of <hi>Redemption,</hi> imports a ſtate of freedom and liberty. 4. Not the moſt excellent of corruptible things, which are moſt valued among men, could be ſufficient to be the price of Redemption for ſinners, one ſoul being of more worth than all things of that ſort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7, 8. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle expreſſeth the price of Redemption ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively; <hi>Not with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold.</hi> 5. It is not impoſſible for ſinners to know themſelves to be of the number of them that are redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt, there being clear marks of ſuch given in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.84. and the Spirit promiſed that they may know the things that are freely beſtowed upon them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. for, the Apoſtle ſuppones this, while he ſaith, <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were redeemed.</hi> 6. The more confident Chriſtians be that they are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the redeemed Ones by Chriſt, the more ſhould they be moved to ſtudy holineſs for the honour of their

Redeemer, conſidering that the ſtudy thereof, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end of their Redemption, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. and the evidence thereof, both to themſelves and to others, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.12. for, this is brought in here by the Apoſtle, as an argument to the ſtudy of holineſs, and particularly, to paſſe the time of our ſojourning here in fear; <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were redeemed, &amp;c.</hi> 7. The ordinary way how the Redeemed of the Lord attain to the knowledge of their Redemption, is, by diſcerning in themſelves a real and gracious change made upon their heart and life by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts death: for, the Apoſtle ſuppones, that thoſe who knew themſelves to be redeemed, behoved alſo to know that they were liberated from their <hi>vain converſation.</hi> 8. While men are not changed in their heart and life, by the application of the merit of that price which Chriſt paid, all that they can do, whether in religious performances, or in their ordinary practiſes, is altogether vain, and ſuch as can bring no true comfort or profit to themſelves, or honour to Jeſus Chriſt: for, ſo the Apoſtle deſigns the way wherein the Redeemed walked before their Regeneration, calling it, <hi>a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:</hi> which may comprehend, both their religious, and common performances. 9. Although there be both a pronenes in fathers, to tranſmit to their children that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs wherein their fathers have rooted and hardened them; and in children, to receive, and tranſmit the ſame to their of-ſpring again; Yet neither is the example, nor precepts of fathers, a ſufficient warrant to their poſterity, for any practiſe whatſoever: for, the Apoſtle imports, that thoſe to whom he writes, had received from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, what they had received from theirs before although it was vain; and reckons it a great advantage, that they were now delivered from that <hi>vain converſation,</hi> although it was <hi>received by tradition from their fathers.</hi> 10. No leſſe could be a ſufficient ranſom for loſt ſinners, than the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; the favours to be purchaſed for them, to make them eternally bleſſed, being of infinite value, and the ſentence of everlaſting death being paſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105751:23"/>
upon all <hi>Adam's</hi> poſterity, either all behoved to die, or one, worth all the reſt; and ſuch an one had never been found, if God had not given His Son to be a man, that ſo man might be redeemed <hi>with the precious bloud of Chriſt.</hi> 11. The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, conſidering the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of His perſon, the greatneſs and freedom of His love, in ſhedding for ſuch as we are, and the worth of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours merited by it to Believers, ſuch as the favour of God and eternal life, ought to be in high eſteem with all the Redeemed: for, to work this in their hearts, the Apoſtle thus commends it, <hi>The precious bloud of Chriſt.</hi> 12. It behoved Him who was to be our Redeemer, to be altogether free of the defilement of ſin, for which He was to ſatisfie in the behalf of others; as being the truth and ſignification of the Paſchal Lamb, to which the Apoſtle here relates; and other ſpotleſs Sacrifices, which typified Him, under the Law, that ſo as man He might be compleatly lovely and acceptable to God, and be a perfect patern of holineſs to all His Redeemed Ones: Therefore, the Apoſtle thus commends Him, <hi>As a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot.</hi>

                  <p>To the end there may be yet a higher eſteem of the Redeemer, wrought in the hearts of the Redeemed, and that they may be the more engaged to the ſtudy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that ſo He may be honoured by them, the Apoſtle goes on to deſcribe Him further. 1. That He was from eternity, appointed by the Father, to be the Saviour of ſinners. And, 2. That He was now more clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted after His incarnation, than He had been before: both which, make up the eight motive to the ſtudy of holineſs, that ſeing Chriſt had been from eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Mediatour, and now more clearly than ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, with a ſpecial reſpect to the good of thoſe loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle writes:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105751:24"/>
Therefore they were bound to live to His honour in the ſtudy of holineſs. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When ever we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any ſerious thoughts of that great buſineſs of our Redemption by Chriſt incarnate and crucified, we ſhould not ſuffer our hearts to be ſoon diverted from them, but ſhould labour to dwell upon them, and to ſearch out more and more conſiderations of that ſweet ſubject; every one of them being worthy to take up our affections, and to engage us to the ſtudy of holineſs: for, the Apoſtle, in the former words having fallen upon the mentioning of our Redemption, as a motive to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, he doth in this, and the following Verſe, run out in expreſſing the thoughts he had of the Lords everlaſting purpoſe about that work, of the glory that Chriſt now poſſeſſes in our nature, and of the Father's intention in exalting Him, <hi>who verily was fore-ordained before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</hi> 2. Our Mediatour was from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity deſigned unto the office of Mediatourſhip, in that everlaſting Covenant of Redemption, wherein the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave the Elect to His Son, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. and appointed Him to aſſume humane nature, therein to ſuffer for their Redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. and Chriſt accordingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſatisfie His will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8. So that we who have Chriſt offered to us in the Goſpel, are invited to feed upon thoſe dainties, that were prepared for us from all eternity; And who are we that the thoughts of God ſhould have been ſo long ſince taken up about us, while He appointed His own Son for us, <hi>who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world?</hi> 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt was made known immediately after the Fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and ever ſince hath been ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted for the ſalvation of the Elect in all Ages, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. Yet there was a more clear manifeſtation of Him, reſerved for the time after His incarnation, the more to heighten the eſteem of that great myſterie of His incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in the hearts of all His People; Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Him here, as more clearly held forth to the Church than before; <hi>But now made manifeſt in theſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105751:24"/>
laſt times for you.</hi> 4. The more clearly Chriſt be held forth in any time, the more ſtrongly are they that live in that time, and have that clearneſs, obliged to live to His honour in the ſtudy of holineſs, conſidering that the more unanſwerable mens walking be to the light they have, the greater will their condemnation be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. and 15.22. they that live ſince the incarnation of Chriſt, and the clearer out-breaking of the light of the Goſpel which reveals Him, ſhould think the Lord hath had a ſpecial reſpect to them, and hath in a peculiar manner deſigned Chriſt for them, and manifeſted Him to them, that they may be more eminent in holineſs and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to Him: for, to this end the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus of Chriſt; <hi>Manifested in theſe laſt times for you.</hi> 5. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though experience hath proven that there was a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of time to be after Chriſts incarnation, yet all that, is but the laſt time, in regard it is to be much ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the time that was before: and becauſe, after that time, though there be a continual increaſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and grace to be expected, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet there is no more change of that way of Worſhip and Ordinances, which Chriſt ſetled before He left the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. for which cauſe, among others, the times after Chriſts incarnation, are here called, <hi>The laſt times.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105751:25"/>
may ſafely and comfortably reſt upon God, as now pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified toward all that flee to Him thorow Chriſt. Which purpoſe doth contain the ninth argument to the ſtudy of holineſs; That ſince the Father hath exalted, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our Cautioner in our nature, for this very end, that we may confidently draw near to Him, as to our own reconciled God, we ought therefore to live to the honour of the Father and the Son in the ſtudy of holineſs. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When ever the Miniſters of Chriſt hold forth the ranſom paid by Chriſt for ſinners, and the benefits purchaſed thereby to them, they ought alſo to deſign and deſcribe the perſons, who may appropriate the ſame to themſelves: and ought not to propoſe that which is peculiar to ſome, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15.) as common to all; So ſhall the few that have right to apply the benefits of His Redemption, be the more ſure and comforted, and others ſhall not be diſappointed: for, ſo doth the Apoſtle here, while, having deſcribed Chriſt the Redeemer, and ſet forth ſome of the benefits of His Redemption, he comes next to deſcribe what manner of perſons they are, who may comfort themſelves in that Redemption purchaſed by Him; even thoſe, <hi>who by Him do believe in God.</hi> 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Faith may cloſe with any one of the bleſſed Perſons of the Trinity, providing we do not divide in our thoughts the Divine Eſſence, which is One in all the Three, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. Yet God the Father, (conſidered as the fountain of the Deity, to whom we come thorow the Second Perſon, cloathed with our fleſh, being helped by the holy Spirit, the Third Perſon) is that full and moſt ſatisfying object, with which ſaving Faith cloſeth, when it acts moſt diſtinctly: for, ſuch an object is here propoſed, with which the Faith of the Redeemed doth cloſe, to wit, the whole Godhead in the Father appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as ours, by the Son incarnate, thorow the help of the Spirit, as the next verſe, compared with this, makes clear. 3. There is no cloſing with God as ours, but by the Mediatour Chriſt, in whom God tryſts with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who hath merited Gods favour to them, the power
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105751:25"/>
to believe the ſame; and actually works that Faith in them, <hi>Who by Him do believe in God.</hi> 4. Although Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, being the ſame God, equal with the Father, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6. did by His own proper vertue, raiſe Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the dead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. and 10.18. Yet to aſſure us of the Fathers full ſatisfaction with the price paid by our Cautioner, and becauſe the power of all the Three Perſons is one, and the actions aſcribed to any of them, in reference to the creatures, are common to all, His rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the dead, and exaltation, is here, (as frequently elſwhere in Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.9.) attributed to the Father, <hi>who raiſed Him from the dead, and gave Him glory.</hi> 5. Gods juſtice is fully ſatisfied in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all that flee to Him through Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe their Cautioner is liberate; and glory is inſured to all ſuch, their Head being already poſſeſſed in it: for, in teſtimony that His ſatisfaction for the Elect is accepted, <hi>God hath raiſed Him from the dead, and,</hi> as a ſure pledge that His Members ſhall be glorified, <hi>He hath given Him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</hi>

                  <p>The tenth motive to preſſe upon Believers the ſtudy of holineſs, is taken from the former progreſs they had made therein: whence the Apoſtle infers an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that particular duty of holineſs, to wit, love to the Saints. The ſum of both is, That ſince by the power of Chriſt's Spirit enabling them to obey the Goſpel; they had gotten their heart-corruptions ſo far purged out, as to attain unto ſome ſincere affection unto the reſt of the Lords People; Therefore they ſhould ſtudy to grow in grace, particularly, in love to the Saints; and that they ſhould labour to have ſuch love to them, as ſloweth from a ſincere deſire of their good; and by the effects of it,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105751:26"/>
doth prove it ſelf to be ſuch. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The fairer beginnings, and further progreſs any have already made in the way of holineſs, they ſhould find themſelves the more ſtrongly obliged to hold on in that way, leſt they loſe the fruit of their former pains, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. and prove more diſhonourable to God, and offenſive to others, than if they had never entered, or made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in that way, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. for, the Apoſtle here makes former progreſs in holineſs, a motive to further progreſs therein: <hi>Seing you have purified your ſouls, &amp;c. ſee that ye love, &amp;c.</hi> 2. As all thoſe, whom the Lord hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly enlightened and renewed, will diſcern in their ſouls many filthy and unclean roots, beſides any that have broken out; ſo their great work ſhould be, to have their ſouls purged from thoſe, knowing that from the polluted fountain of the heart flows all the pollution of the life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19. and that, except the heart be in ſome meaſure cleanſed, all the purity of the outſide is loathſom to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.27. for, the Apoſtle thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the Regenerate, that they <hi>have purified their ſouls.</hi> 3. Although it be the alone work of God, as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal efficient cauſe, to cleanſe and purifie the ſouls of His People, both from the guilt and dominion of ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. Yet His People, who are meerly paſſive in the firſt infuſion of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. are thereafter made by Him, active inſtruments in the carrying on of that work of mortification, by employing Chriſts vertue for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing, and fighting in His ſtrength againſt, their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as is imported in this, <hi>Ye have purified your ſouls:</hi> 4. The Lords mean of purging the ſouls of His People, from the love and power of ſin, which is naturally in them, is their obedience to His Truth: which conſiſts, not only in their aiming at conformity to thoſe precepts, which enjoyn purity and holineſs, ſuch as that is, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. but principally, in their imbracing by Faith, and uſe-making of, the promiſes of the new Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord undertakes to work this purity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. This is the chief part of that obedience to the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105751:26"/>
Truth, which purifieth ſouls: for, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ye have purified your ſouls, in obeying the Truth.</hi> 5. This obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Truth, which purifieth the ſouls of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, cannot be attained unto, by our own naturall ſtrength, or the uſe of the fitteſt means of grace, without the ſpecial working of the Spirit of Jeſus, who cleareth to ſinners the nature of that purity, which is pleaſing to God, and powerfully worketh the ſame in them: for, ſo the Apoſtle affirms of thoſe Believers, that they had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified their ſouls in obeying the Truth, <hi>through the Spirit.</hi> 6. One ſpecial part of this work of purging the ſouls of Believers, conſiſts in the ſubduing of thoſe filthy roots, which are in their hearts, contrary to that grace of love to the reſt of the Lords People, ſuch as pride, ſelf-love, and the like: for, this is here made their aim, in purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſouls, that they might attain <hi>unto unfeigned love of the Brethren:</hi> importing, that their pains was much bent to purge out thoſe evils, which are contrary to that grace. 7. Believers have need to be ſeriouſly preſſed to exerciſe and grow in theſe graces and duties, whereof they have already attained to ſome approven meaſure: for, upon thoſe who had already purified their ſouls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unfeigned love of the Brethren, the Apoſtle preſſeth this, <hi>See that ye love one another.</hi> 8. It is not every ſort of love to the Saints of God that evidenceth mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the indwelling of Chriſts Spirit; but ſuch only, as is without diſſimulation or hypocriſie, which is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned love,</hi> ſuch as flows from holy principles, to wit, reſpect to the Command of Chriſt, and not from reſpect to our own credit or advantage only; from deſire of the true good of others, and not from love to our ſelves, which is <hi>Love out of a pure heart;</hi> and ſuch as breaks forth in real proofs, and is continued toward others, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of provocations from them, which is, <hi>To love one another fervently.</hi>

                  <p>The eleventh motive, whereby the Apoſtle preſſeth upon Believers the ſtudy of holineſs, (eſpecially, that branch of it, which he was laſt upon, to wit, Love to the Saints) is taken from the excellency of their ſpiritual original: the ſum whereof is, That ſince they had a new life and nature in their regeneration, wrought in them, not by ſo fading a cauſe of principle, as that which is the inſtrument of producing their natural ſubſtance, but by the Word of God, which, in the effects it hath upon the Regenerate, liveth and abideth for ever; Therefore the excellency of their new nature, and permanency of their ſpiritual eſtate, ſhould move them to walk ſuitably unto it; and particularly, to live in love with the reſt of their Fathers Children. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Every true Believer in Jeſus Chriſt, is in ſome meaſure acquainted with a new and ſecond birth, which is that work of God with ſinners, whereby there is a new ſpiritual life and nature communicated to them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. and they are brought through ſome pangs and ſtraits, ariſing from the ſight of their own ſinfulneſs, and fear of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved wrath, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. out of their darkneſs and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, (which is natural to them, and is reſembled by the ſtate of the child before the birth) into a ſtate of light, and knowledge of God in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the ſlavery of ſin, and ſubjection to wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. and whereby alſo they are made, in ſome meaſure, to reſemble their heavenly Father, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to obey Him, and to love Him, and all His Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. for, this the Apoſtle makes a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true Believers, that they are <hi>born again.</hi> 2. Our life and nature, that we have by vertue of this ſecond birth, or regeneration, is far more excellent than what we have by the firſt: our natural eſtate is ſubject to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105751:27"/>
corruption, and will be ſhortly diſſolved; but our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eſtate can never fade: for, though all have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls that are not corruptible, yet the natural life and ſtate of all ſhall be diſſolved, and the eternal being of thoſe who are unacquainted with Regeneration, and a ſecond birth, will be but an eternal corruption, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, which ſhould make all long to be acquainted with Regeneration: for, to lead us to eſteem the one above the other, the Apoſtle commends the one above the other from the difference of their ſeeds; <hi>Not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible.</hi> 3. Although the Word, ſeparated from the working of the Spirit, can do nothing to the regenerating of a ſinner, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. yet the Word is the ordinary inſtrument of the Spirit, who makes uſe of all the principal parts of it in that work; of the Law, to put the ſinner in ſome ſtraits of the ſecond birth, through fear of deſerved wrath; and of the Goſpel, to revive the ſoul, and liberate it from thoſe fears; and of the Law again, to direct the Regenerate how to walk ſuitably to their eſtate: for, the Apoſtle explains what that incorruptible ſeed is, of which we are born again, to wit, <hi>The Word of God.</hi> 4. Although there be no life, either formally, or by way of efficiency, in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or ſound of the words of Scripture; and though that Word paſſeth with the ſpeaking, as any other words do; Yet in regard of the effects, which through the operation of the Spirit it hath upon ſinners, ſuch as fear, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror upon the believing of the threatnings, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. comfort under croſſes, and quickning for duties upon the believing of the promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. It is, as the Apoſtle here calleth it, <hi>A Word that liveth;</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the execution of eternal wrath upon them that reject it, and of the performance of thoſe everlaſting bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which are promiſed in it, to them that receive and obey it, it is <hi>a Word that abideth for ever.</hi> 5. They who do profeſſe, and eſteem themſelves to be of the number of thoſe who are born again, ſhould, by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſecond birth, be ſtrongly moved to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105751:28"/>
of holineſs, for the honour of their Father; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to live in love with the reſt of their Fathers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: for, the Apoſtle brings this as a further argument to the ſtudy of holineſs, (and particularly to the ſtudy of that branch of it, which he had preſſed in the former words, concerning mutual love amongſt Profeſſours) that they were <hi>born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, by the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The laſt motive, whereby the Apoſtle preſſeth upon Believers the ſtudy of holineſs, and conſtancy under ſufferings, is taken from a further commendation of the excellency of their ſpiritual eſtate, which the Apoſtle ſets out by comparing the ſame with the beſt eſtate of men naturally conſidered, with all their ornaments, wherein they uſe to glory, which is (according to the Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6.) like unto withering graſſe, and fading flowers. In the application of which compariſon, the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon his former commendation of the Word (which is the ſeed, whereby Believers are begotten) from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of it, to wit, in the effects thereof upon them, which might eaſily lead them to judge of their ſtate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and applies this commendation of the Word to that Doctrine, which was preached to them by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or others of the Lords Servants. All which doth ſtrongly preſſe his ſcope, that therefore they ſhould live holily, and ſuffer chearfully, as became thoſe who were in ſo excellent an eſtate. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although it be much in the thoughts and deſires of natural men, that they might have a perpetual enjoyment of this life, and the comforts of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.11. Yet themſelves, and all that they can glory in, is frail and fading, like the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105751:28"/>
graſſe, and flowers of the graſſe; whereupon they ſhould read their frailty and mortality, and ſo be ſtirred up to provide for a better life, and a more enduring ſubſtance than what they have here: for, <hi>all fleſh is as graſſe, and all the glory of man as the flower of graſſe.</hi> 2. Though every common gift of God wherein men uſe to glory, whether riches, wiſdom, ſtrength, beauty, or the like, be fading as the graſſe and flowers thereof; Yet, becauſe mens cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or glory before the world, is that wherein they uſe to glory moſt; and of the perpetuating whereof, they are moſt ſtrongly deſirous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.11. The Lord hath put a ſpecial fadingneſs and vanity upon that, and will have it as eaſily blaſted as any other thing wherein men glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for, though <hi>the glory of man,</hi> here ſpoken of, may be taken largely, as comprehending every thing for which men lift up themſelves, and wherein they uſe to glory, as the word is uſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.8. Yet it ſeems eſpecially to point out that honour and credit, which men affect to have before the world; in which ſignification it is uſed, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.6. the property whereof, the Lord pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to be fadingneſs or withering; <hi>And all the glory of man, as the flower of graſſe.</hi> 3. Though this be a plain Truth, taught by daily experience, and commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that our natural eſtate with all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, is frail and fading; Yet, it is not eaſie to make this Truth take due impreſſion upon the hearts of men, who are naturally unwilling to admit thoughts of a change, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.2. Therefore the Spirit of God bears it in upon mens minds, under the ſame ſimilitude, in very many places of Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 14.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.10. and here by many expreſſions; <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and all the glory of man as the flower of graſſe: the graſſe withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away.</hi> 4. The believing conſideration of this frailty and fading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mens natural eſtate and earthly contentments, ſhould heighten in their hearts the eſteem of that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and better eſtate, whereunto by receiving the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel they may be advanced; and ſhould be to them a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105751:29"/>
powerful motive to the ſtudy of holineſs, which will abide when other things do fade, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to the ſtudy of mutual love among themſelves, (thoſe earthly things for which uſually they contend, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.8. and particularly their credit, the love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is often the greateſt occaſion of ſtrife among them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.24. being ſo fading and uncertain;) for, as a commendation of the ſtate of the Regenerate, or motive to the ſtudy of holineſs, and particularly of brotherly love, is this here brought in, <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and all the glory of man as the flower of graſſe: the graſſe withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: But the Word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> 5. What ever can be ſpoken to the commendation of the <hi>Word,</hi> ſerves alſo for the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them who have by faith received it, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by it: That which is the ſeed and principle of their ſpiritual being, their charter, and right to all their priviledges and inheritance, being excellent and worthy, their ſtate muſt needs be ſuch likewiſe: for, it is clear the Apoſtles purpoſe here, is, to commend the ſtate of the Regenerate, as far more excellent than the beſt natural ſtate; and this he eſteems to be ſufficiently done, by commending the <hi>Word,</hi> from the perpetuity of it, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the frail ſtate of men naturally conſidered, <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, &amp;c. But the Word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> 6. They who have received a new ſpiritual life, and ſo are entered in a new ſtate, by their receiving of the <hi>Word,</hi> ought to fix in their hearts, by frequent medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the perpetuity of that <hi>Word,</hi> in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good things promiſed therein, which ſhall endure to them for all eternity, that ſo they may the better ſee, and be the more affected with their own bleſſedneſs: for, the Apoſtle, having commended the <hi>Word</hi> from this property of it before, repeats it here again, <hi>The Word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> 7. As Chriſts own worth and excellency, is beſt ſeen when He is compared with other things, which may ſeem to have worth in them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. So the worth of our ſpiritual eſtate, is beſt ſeen,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105751:29"/>
and moſt eſteemed of by us, when we compare it with the frailty and fectleſneſs of the beſt ſtate on Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: for, to heighten Believers eſteem of the one, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it with the other: <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, &amp;c. but the Word of the Lord</hi> (and conſequently their ſtate, who are begotten again by the <hi>Word) endureth for ever.</hi> 8. What ever good eſteem the Lord's People have of the <hi>Word</hi> of God in general, they ought to have the ſame or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Meſſages that are brought to them from, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Word,</hi> by the Lord's Servants, who are ſent unto them; and ought not to content themſelves with a high eſteem of the written <hi>Word,</hi> or of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof in the general, in the mean time having a ſlender eſteem of theſe portions of Truth, which God carves out to them by the Meſſengers whom He ſends to them: for, the Apoſtle leads thoſe to whom he writes, to look upon that commendation of the <hi>Word,</hi> which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had given out before him, as agreeing to the <hi>Word</hi> written, and preached to them by himſelf, and others of the Lord's Servants in that time: <hi>And this is the Word which by the Gospel is preached unto you.</hi> 9. Although the precepts and threatnings of the <hi>Word,</hi> have their own efficiency as inſtruments in Gods hand, to prepare the ſoul for the new life, by breaking and humbling of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. Yet it is mainly the Goſpel, or the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings (as the word ſignifies) of free ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt, to all loſt ſinners, who get grace to receive the offer thereof, whereby a new life is conveyed to, and increaſed, in the ſoul, and whereby it is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that excellent ſtate of Regeneration: for, the Apoſtle applies the commendation of the <hi>Word,</hi> which is the ſeed of Regeneration, mainly to the Goſpel; <hi>And this is the Word, which by the Gospel is preached unto you.</hi>

               <p>IN this Chapter, the Apoſtle goes on to preſſe ſuch duties of holineſs, as are moſt ſuitable for that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtate of the Regenerate, deſcribed in the former. In the firſt part of it, he exhorts to growth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in ſuch duties of holineſs as concern all Chriſtians in whatſoever relation they ſtand in the world, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſtudy of mortification, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. a hearty indrinking of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, becauſe their ſo doing, is the means of their ſpiritual growth, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. It is the way to prove that they had experimentally taſted of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt's grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and becauſe by their daily uſe-making of Chriſt, offered in the Goſpel, they ſhould find an increaſe of ſpiritual life, and fitneſs for every duty, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. and that becauſe the Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth Him to be given with the Father's good will for a ſolid foundation of ſalvation and comfort to every ſoul that flyes to Him, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Whence the Apoſtle infers, that Chriſt cannot but be very dear to Believers, and that He ſhall not be the leſſe glorious that many ſlight Him; who, by their ſo doing, ſhall only ruine themſelves, and prove themſelves Reprobates, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. But as for thoſe whom he hath ſo highly honoured, that they might be forth-coming for his praiſe, who had made ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a change upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 9 10. Their great ſtudy ought to be, to keep up the battel againſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward luſts, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and to walk ſo as the moſt wicked among whom they converſe, may be allured to fall in love with Chriſtianity, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond part of the Chapter, the Apoſtle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuch duties as are ſuitable for Chriſtians, conſidered under ſome of their ſpecial relations. And firſt, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them, as ſubjects under heathen Rulers, to reſpect every form of lawfull Government, whether in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſupream or inferiour Magiſtrate: and this he preſſeth by many arguments; Firſt, Becauſe they ſhould
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105751:30"/>
thereby evidence their reſpect to Gods Command. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe Magiſtrates are appointed of God for ſo good ends as he expreſſeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. Thirdly, They ſhould thereby ſilence their ſlanderers, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Becauſe otherwiſe they ſhould abuſe their Chriſtian Liberty unto licentiouſneſs. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And fifthly, Becauſe other unqueſtionable duties did neceſſarily infer this, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Secondly, He exhorts them as ſervants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heathen perſecuting Maſters, in which caſe many Chriſtians then were, to carry themſelves dutifully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuch Maſters, and patiently under wrongs from them, whether they were of the worſt or better ſort, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and this the Apoſtle preſſeth to the end of the Chapter, by ſeverall reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe they might expect a gracious reward from God, if they were put to unjuſt ſufferings from men for reſpect to his Commands, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. Secondly, Becauſe it would be a diſgrace for Chriſtianity, if Chriſtians did deſerve hard uſage from Heathens for their miſcarriage, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. Thirdly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were obliged to patience under the Croſſe, by their Calling. Fourthly, Becauſe Chriſt had ſuffered harder things for them. Fifthly, Becauſe He had caſt them a ſweet Copy of the right way of ſuffering, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. Sixthly, Becauſe Chriſt was a moſt innocent ſufferer, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Seventhly, Becauſe He was the moſt patient. And eighthly, the moſt confident, under greateſt wrongs that ever was, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Ninthly, Becauſe by His death He hath purchaſed Reconciliation with God. And, tenthly, healing to all his Peoples wounds, eſpecially for his cauſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. Eleventhly, Since they who were once in the way to perdition, were now brought to a ſtate of ſafety by Him, <hi>ver.</hi> laſt. Therefore they ought patiently to ſuffer wrongs in following their duty to Him: the preſſing whereof, is the Apoſtle's ſcope.</p>

                  <p>THe Apoſtle's ſcope, in the firſt part of this Chapter, being to preſſe upon all Chriſtians the ſtudy of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe and growth in holineſs, as appears by the ſecond and fifth Verſes, he doth, in order to this, ſtir them up to the battel againſt their unmortified corruptions, giving inſtances of ſuch, as are moſt contrary unto that love of the Regenerate, one toward another, which he had preſt before, as an evidence of their Regeneration, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and to that hearty receiving of the Word which he preſſeth in the following Verſe, as the principal means of their growth in grace, not excluding other evils, not here mentioned, but leading them by theſe to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all the reſt, that are unbeſeeming a regenerate ſtate. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There doth remain in the Children of the Lord, not only after their Regeneration, but even after ſome progreſſe in mortification, many ſtrong cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and filthy frames or ſpirit, which are left to humble them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. and to ſtir them up to earneſt imployment of Jeſus Chriſt, both for mercy, and power to ſubdue them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. for, upon thoſe whom the Apoſtle ſupponed to be not only born again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.23. but to have attained to a good degree of mortification, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. he doth here preſſe that they ſhould <hi>lay aſide malice, and guile, and hypocriſie, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Our corruptions ought to be renounced with deteſtation, as things very noiſom to be longer kept, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.22. and with a purpoſe never to meddle with them again, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. for, there is a metaphor in the words, taken from a man putting off an old ſuit of cloaths, full of filth and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which would be both hurtful and diſgraceful to be longer worn; <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all malice, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Even the Children of the Lord are ready to cleave very cloſe to their unmortified corruptions; to forget the neceſſity of a further, degree of mortification than what they have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105751:31"/>
already attained unto; and to entertain their corruptions as if they were neceſſary for them; yea, and to accompt them their very ornaments: for, the metaphor in the words is taken from a man that is unwilling to ſhed with his garments, which, though they be old and full of filth and vermine, yet he keeps them cloſe to him, as his neceſſary ornaments: <hi>lay aſide all malice, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Our Regeneration, and former progreſs in mortification, ſhould be ſo far from making us indulgent to our luſts, remaining yet unmortified, that the more clear we be concerning the one, and the further advanced in the other, the more are we obliged to ſet againſt the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of thoſe unmortified corruptions, we having now ſtronger obligations to ſight againſt them, greater ſtrength for that effect, and being more ready to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God by their prevailing, than formerly: for, upon thoſe whom the Apoſtle ſupponed to be born again, to know themſelves Redeemed Ones, and to have purified their ſouls, in the former Chapter, he preſſes here the ſtudy of mortification, with a <hi>Wherefore, laying aſide, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Our new birth is mainly evidenced to us by our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of, and victory over thoſe corruptions which ſtir in us, contrary to that love and duty which we owe to our Brethren, the reſt of the Regenerate Ones; our victory over theſe being the kindly effect of our victory in ſome meaſure, over our ignorance of God, Atheiſm, and unbelief, and ſuch other ſins as are more directly againſt the firſt Table, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, 3. for, all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular evils here named, are ſuch as relate mainly to our neighbour, as contrary to that love and duty which we owe to him; and the mortification of them is here preſt, as that which ſhould evidence our Regeneration, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by comparing the 23. Verſe of the former Chapter, with this and the Verſe following: <hi>Being born again, &amp;c. Wherefore, laying aſide all malice, &amp;c. as new born babes, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Not only is the actual hurting of our neighbour an evil, unbeſeeming the Regenerate Ones, but the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the heart to harm him, is ſuch an evil alſo;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105751:32"/>
and therefore to be mortified for intention to hurt out neighbour, is the firſt evil, which the Apoſtle here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades from; <hi>laying aſide malice, &amp;c.</hi> 7. The Lord takes notice of folks cunning conveyances, of their plots and practices, which tend to the prejudice of others; thoſe being more dangerous to the party, and more grievous, when diſcovered, or, felt in their effects, than more open injuries, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.11, 12, 13. for, that artificial way of hurting others, which hides the hurt intended from the party, is the next evil the Apoſtle exhorts to be laid aſide, as is clear from the ſignification of the original word, <hi>guile.</hi> 8. As hypocriſie, in the matters of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſtians draw near Him with their lips, while their hearts are far from Him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.7, 8. and give out themſelves to be much for Him, when they are nothing ſo, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. is an evil very deteſtable to Him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.25. So hypocriſie in dealing with others, whereby men in their words and carriage behave themſelves with ſeeming reſpect and love, in the mean time aiming at the diſgrace and hurt of others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.21. is a guilt unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the Regenerate, which they ſhould ſtudy to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, as they deſire to prove themſelves ſuch: for, of both theſe ſorts of hypocriſies may this third evil be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which the Apoſtle exhorts to be laid aſide; <hi>and hypocriſies.</hi> 9. To be grieved and vexed at the good of others, their excellencies or preference before our ſelves, as it is a frame of ſpirit natural to all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the Regenerate, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.5. So it is an evil very deteſtable to God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. and hurtful to the perſon in whom it is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.30. and therefore to be oppoſed, and mortified, as moſt unbeſeeming the Regenerate, who ſhould rejoyce in the welfare one of another, as if it were their own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. for, this is the fourth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which the Apoſtle here exhorts to mortifie; <hi>and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies:</hi> which word, ſignifies an evil, waſting them that have it with grief at others welfare. 10. Evil ſpeaking of others, is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105751:32"/>
to be prevalent in the heart, when there is in the tongue much reviling, backbiting, contradicting, and other ſorts of evil ſpeakings, whereby the reputation of our neighbour is hurt: for, as this is here the laſt in order, ſo it may be ſafely looked upon as the effect, or ordinary conſequent of the former; <hi>laying aſide all malice and guile, and envies, and evil ſpeakings.</hi> 11. However there may be ſome one ſin, to which the heart of the Regenerate is more inclined than to others, againſt which one, they ſhould mainly bend their ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. Yet, as they deſire to prove themſelves Regenerate, they ought to oppoſe and mortifie all ſin, conſidering that they are weak before every temptation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 3. and that the root and branch of every ſin is hatefull to God, and contrary to His holy Law, as is clear by Chriſt's expoſition of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, and 6. <hi>chap.</hi> for, the Apoſtle puts the note of univerſality to ſome of theſe evils, and puts the reſt in the plural number; <hi>laying aſide all malice, and guile, and hypocriſies, &amp;c,</hi> 12. There are degrees of the ſtrength of unmortified corruption, and ſeveral wayes how it vents it ſelf; ſo that when one branch of it is cut off, and one way how it doth prevail is ſtopped, there are yet many other branches of that ſame ſin to be ſearched out, and foughten againſt: for the firſt two evils here named have an <hi>all</hi> with them, importing, that when one branch, or degree of malice and guile is laid aſide, there may be yet much of them behind unmortified: And the reſt of the evils here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are in the plural number, importing, that there are many ſorts and kinds of <hi>envies, and hypocriſies, and evil ſpeakings,</hi> to be mortified in every Chriſtian; <hi>VVherefore lay aſide all malice, and all guile, and hypocriſies, and envies, and evil speakings.</hi> 13. The right order which Believers ſhould keep in the mortifying of ſin, is to begin with the inward root<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> there of that are in their hearts, ſo ſhall they the more eaſily curb the ſins of the outward man: for, in this order the Apoſtle preſſeth this ſtudy upon the Regenerate, that they ſhould firſt <hi>lay aſide malice and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105751:33"/>
guile, &amp;c.</hi> and then <hi>evil speakings.</hi> 14. There is no right receiving of the Word, ſo as ſouls may grow by it, till firſt they ſet about the mortifying and putting off of ſuch filthy frames of ſpirit as are here named: the Truth muſt be received in love, both to Chriſt and all His People, to which the evils here named are contrary: for, the laying aſide of them is here preſſed as a mean toward the duty, held forth in the following Verſe: <hi>Wherefore, laying aſide all malice, &amp;c. deſire the ſincere milk of the Word.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle, having diſſwaded from thoſe evils which are great hinderances to the right receiving of the Goſpel, doth here, in the next place, exhort the Regenerate to labor for ſuch a ſharp edge upon their appetite after the Truths of the Goſpel, by which they were begotten, and muſt be nouriſhed, as lively infants have after the milk of the mothers breaſts. And this exhortation the Apoſtle bears in by three motives in this Verſe, taken from the nature, and effects of the Truths of the Goſpel. 1. That thoſe Truths are the <hi>ſincere milk,</hi> that is, moſt pure Truths, without any mixture of falſhood or error. 2. That they are full of ſpiritual reaſon, and ſo ſuited to the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied underſtandings of men and women; for, the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal may be rendred, <hi>that rational milk.</hi> 3.

from more profound Truths, which have the name of ſtrong meat, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13, 14. Yet, for the cauſes formerly mentioned, the whole word is here called <hi>Milk,</hi> to be much thirſted-after by all the Regenerate: <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word.</hi> 2. The deſire of a truly regenerate perſon after the Word, will in ſome meaſure reſemble that deſire after the breaſts, which is in new born babes: for, as the beſt thing on earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the breaſts, cannot be ſatisfactory to a lively infant; as it is moſt grieved for the want thereof, moſt unwilling to ſhed with it, and moſt delighted to have it of any other thing; So is it with the Regenerate in reference to the Word, as is imported in this exhortation, <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word.</hi> 3. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Regenerate after the Word, ought to extend it ſelf to all the parts thereof, every one of theſe having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon their ſpiritual growth: The diſcovering and threatning part of it, ſerving them as a glaſs wherein to ſee their defects and ſpots, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. that ſo they may be chaſed to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. The promiſes thereof being the channel through which, life, ſtrength, and transforming vertue to make them reſemble their Lord, is conveyed to them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and the precepts and directions thereof, ſerving as a Lamp to direct them in their chriſtian courſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. for, here the Word indefinitly, without reſtriction to one part of it more than another, is by the Apoſtle held forth as the object of this deſire of the Regenerate; <hi>deſire the ſincere milk of the VVord.</hi> 4. This deſire of the Word, formerly deſcribed, is a clear evidence of Regeneration, and a new nature; no ſooner is a ſinner born again by the vertue of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit working with the Word, but as ſoon is there a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appetite after the Word wrought in the ſinners heart, even as the infant preſently after the birth, doth evidence ſome inclination and deſire after the breaſts: for, the Apoſtle, having aſſerted their new birth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. doth here put them to evidence it: <hi>As new born babes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſincere milk of the Word.</hi> 5. There is nothing in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105751:34"/>
the Word of the Lord to deceive any that get grace to receive it by Faith, and walk by it, there being no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Error with the Truths therein delivered, or of falſhood, either in the promiſes, threatnings, or predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof: and therefore Miniſters in handling of it, ſhould keep it free of the mixture of their own inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and paſſions; and People ſhould love it, and reſt upon it, becauſe it is <hi>the ſincere milk of the Word,</hi> or, as the Original is, the Word without guile, or mixture of any thing that deceives. 6. Although natural reaſon of it ſelf, except it be elevated above it ſelf, and enlightened by the Lord, cannot comprehend the Truths revealed in the Goſpel, nor look upon them as reaſonable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 23. and 2.14. Yet all of them are moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in themſelves, and cannot but be acknowledged to be ſuch, by all that have the uſe of ſanctified reaſon, when they conſider what ſubjection and credit, we owe to Him of whom we have our being; when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare His Precepts and Commands, with His Promiſes of furniture for obedience, and of a gracious reward thereof; and when they conſider how Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are agreed, Righteouſneſs and Peace do kiſſe each other, in that way of Salvation which is deviſed through Chriſt incarnate; and that neither theſe Truths, nor any other in Scripture, are contrary to pure natural reaſon, though ſome of them be far above the reach of it: for, this Text may be tranſlated (as the like word is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. —1.) <hi>deſire that rational and ſincere milk.</hi> 7. There are none of the Children of the Lord ſo far advanced in knowledge, grace or holineſs, as that they ought to be ſatisfied with their meaſure, but ought ſtill to aſpire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a further degree of growth, both downward in humility, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22. and ſtability, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. and abroad in publick-mindedneſs, kything it ſelf in real endeavours after the ſalvation and comfort of others, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5, 6, 7. and upward in joy and praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.14. for, upon thoſe who were already far advanced in grace, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23. is growth here preſſed; <hi>deſire the ſincere milk
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105751:34"/>
of the VVord, that ye may grow.</hi> 8. According to the ſtrength of our deſires after, and greedy in-drinking of the Word by application and uſe making thereof, ſo will be our growth in grace and holineſs: They cannot but be under a great decay in both, who have loſt their appetite after the Goſpel: for, this deſire after the Word, is here preſt by the Apoſtle, as a mean of growth; <hi>deſire the ſincere milk, that ye may grow thereby.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth motive to ſharpen their appetite after the Word, is, That if they did greedily drink it in, that they might grow by it, their ſo doing ſhould prove to them the reality of any experience they ſeemed unto themſelves to have of the graciouſneſs or ſweetneſs of the Lord to them: of which, whoſoever gets a taſt, they cannot but thirſt earneſtly after more of it through the Word; and they who do not ſo thirſt, cannot conclude they have taſted thereof. And therefore an eager appetite after the Word is to be laboured for. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom Believers ſeek and ſerve, hath in Him every thing that may be uſefull and ſweet for them, and a ſtrong benſel in his heart to let out the ſame to them; whereof he hath given abundant proof, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding ſuch a remedy for loſt ſinners, as Himſelf to die for them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in His daily pardoning of their daily failings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. in His ſuccouring of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their extremities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. and in His waiting the fitteſt opportunity for proving Himſelf to be ſuch a one to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.18. for, all theſe, and much more, are in this attribute of His, as the Scriptures cited, which do expreſſe the effects of His graciouſneſs, do make clear: and therefore it cannot but be ſweet to all that ever <hi>have taſted how gracious the Lord is.</hi> 2. Although all that are in the world, do, in ſome ſenſe, taſt of the goodneſs of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. Yet only His own Elect and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Ones taſt of His graciouſneſs, as it is manifeſted in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105751:35"/>
the forementioned effects thereof: for, it is only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, who are ſupponed here to have <hi>taſted how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Lord is.</hi> 3. Although the way of Believers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and feeling of this graciouſneſs, or ſweetneſs of the Lord, be ſpiritual, ariſing in their hearts from their exerciſing of their Faith in God, as favourable to them through Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. Yet it is no leſſe real and certain, then that which is by any of the outward ſenſes cloſing with, and delighting in, their proper objects. Therefore as it is elſwhere in Scripture ſet forth by ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8. and by ſeeing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.25. So here (as alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8.) by taſting; <hi>If ſo be ye have taſted how gracious the Lord is.</hi> 4. All that Believers get of Chriſt in this life, is, in compariſon of that full enjoyment of Him, which they ſhall have in the life to come, but a taſt, a ſparing meaſure to ſharpen appetite after more: for, ſo it is here called <hi>a taſting how gracious the Lord is.</hi> 5. That which proves our taſts of Chriſt's ſweetneſs to be kindly, and proper to the Regenerate, is, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our inward and beloved luſts are weakened, and we are made to lay them aſide, and to loath them, and our deſires after the Word are more ſharpened; by which the ſweet feelings of the Regenerate are differenced from thoſe which hypocrites may have, which have no ſuch concommitants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. for, by conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of this Verſe with the former two, it appears the Apoſtle hath preſt mortification of ſin, and deſire after the Word for growth, as things which could not but be in them, <hi>if ſo be they had taſted how gracious the Lord is.</hi> 6. All thoſe taſts of the graciouſneſs and ſweetneſs of Chriſt, which the Saints may expect in this life, are to be looked for in, and through the Word: for, while he makes their former taſts of that kind, an argument to ſharpen their deſires after the Word, he doth clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that both their former taſts of that ſort, had been through the Word, and that more of theſe taſts were to be found the ſame way, and no way elſe: <hi>deſire the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk, &amp;c. if ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious:</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:105751:35"/>
and ſo would deſire to taſt more of that ſort. 7. All the former experiences we have had of the graciouſneſs and ſweetneſs of Chriſt, ſhould ſharpen and put an edge upon our deſires after more of that ſort, and after the Word, through which thoſe experiences are conveyed: for, to quicken their appetite after the Word, through which the Lord's People taſt of His ſweetneſs, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their former taſts here; <hi>If ſo be ye have taſted than the Lord is gracious.</hi>

                  <p>Here is the fifth motive to the hearty receiving of the Word, taken from the great advantage of daily cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt offered therein: and this advantage the Apoſtle ſets forth in ſeveral branches; as firſt, That Chriſt ſhould prove Himſelf a living; and, ſecondly, a ſolid foundation, to ſuch as by Faith build themſelves upon Him. Thirdly, That however the moſt part of men reject Him as unworthy to be their choice, yet is He the Father's choice, and, as our Mediatour, in high eſteem with Him, and therefore worthy to be our choice, and daily to be made uſe of, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Fourthly, That they who do cloſe with Him, as the Goſpel offers Him, ſhall be made in ſome meaſure conform to Him in ſpiritual life and ſtability. Fifthly, That their union with Chriſt, and the reſt of the Saints, ſhould be growing more and more ſtrait. Sixthly, That ſo they ſhould be made fit for entertaining communion with Himſelf, dwelling in them by his Spirit, as in his ſpiritual Temple. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, That by their ſo doing, they ſhould prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be a People conſecrated to the Lord (as the Prieſts were of old) to offer up their prayers, praiſes, and other parts of their Worſhip, which Chriſt, to whom
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105751:36"/>
they are dayly coming, doth make well-pleaſing to the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. From <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. With how much greater deſire we do receive the Truths of the Goſpel, by ſo much the more do we come nearer to Jeſus Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered therein, to enjoy a comfortable communion with Him, and to partake of the benefits purchaſed by Him: for, if we obſerve the current of the Apoſtle's ſpeech, we may ſee that in ſtead of ſhewing the advantages of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Goſpel, he ſhews the advantages of cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, offered therein, importing theſe two to be one; <hi>To whom coming, as unto a living ſtone.</hi> 2. It is not enough that ſinners once come to Chriſt for life, and do cloſe with Him, as the Word offers Him to them; but they muſt make a trade, and a life of coming to Him, daily renewing and ſtrengthening the acts of their Faith in Him, for pardon and furniture for every thing they have to do, there being much diſtance ſtill remaining betwixt Him and the beſt while they are here, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.28. and ſtill a nearer communion with Him attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.13. for, coming to Chriſt, which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is believing in Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. is here preſt upon thoſe who had believed in Him before, and that by ſuch a word in the preſent time, as ſignifies the continuation and renewing of the acts of Faith: <hi>To whom coming, &amp;c.</hi> 3. There is no growth in grace or holineſs, nor in ability to oppoſe our corruptions, except we be thus coming frequently to Jeſus Chriſt, in whom the fulneſs of grace is, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. and who is both our righteouſneſs, and our ſtrength for all we have to do, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. for, this coming to Chriſt here preſt, may be looked upon as the mean of growth in mortification and every grace, as is clear by comparing this, <hi>to whom coming, &amp;c.</hi> with what goeth before, and follows after. 4. All that come to Jeſus Chriſt ſhall find Him a ſolid foundation to reſt upon, able to bear them and all their burdens, conſtant in His love to them, and in the fulfilling of all His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; and as ſuch, He is daily to be cloſed with: for, for theſe and the like cauſes, He is here ſet forth, as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105751:36"/>
the object of Faith, under the ſimilitude of <hi>a ſtone,</hi> 5. Chriſt is a living foundation for ſinners to build them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon, having life in Himſelf eſſentially, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. and communicating life ſpiritual and eternal, to every ſoul that cloſes with Him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. for, ſo alſo is he here propoſed, as the object of ſaving Faith, <hi>to whom coming, as unto a living ſtone.</hi> 6. Felt deadneſs ſhould not keep any ſoul back from Jeſus Chriſt, who ſee need of life from Him, and hazard of eternal death without Him, it being impoſſible to attain to ſpiritual or eternal life but by cloſing with Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. for, <hi>coming to Him, as to a living ſtone,</hi> imports, that the deſire of life, ſhould draw ſouls that do find much deadneſs ſpiritual, and do fear death eternal to Him; <hi>To whom coming, as to a living ſtone.</hi> 7. There is not another rock or foundation-ſtone, whereupon the Church or any true Member thereof, can be built, but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. The Prophets and Apoſtles, are only called the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. in ſo far as they hold out, in their Doctrine, this living foundation: and this Apoſtle, by that Rock, whereupon Chriſt ſaid He would build His Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. did not underſtand himſelf, or his ſucceſſours, (though never ſo faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) but Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf, whom he had a little before confeſſed to be this living ſtone: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thus holds Him forth here; <hi>To whom coming, as unto a living ſtone.</hi> 8. Though Chriſt be a ſolid and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving foundation for ſinners to reſt upon, Yet is He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the moſt part of men, as unworthy to be their choice, He having little outward glory to draw hearts toward Him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. and all men being naturally blind concerning His ſpiritual excellency, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. and their own need of Him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. and there being but a very few, in compariſon of the reſt, that are given unto Him, to be ſaved by Him, <hi>Job.</hi> 12.39. therefore is it that He is <hi>diſallowed indeed of men.</hi> 9. Others rejecting of Chriſt, ſhould be ſo far from diſcouraging His own to cloſe with Him, and make uſe of Him, that by the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105751:37"/>
contrary, it ſhould move them to a more hearty and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent cloſing with Him, being confident that He ſhall deal the better with them, that they are not hindered or diſcouraged by the example of rejecters, from cloſing with Him: for, even this may be alſo looked upon, as having the ſtrength of an argument to move thoſe who have hitherto been ſtrangers to Chriſt, to come now to Him; and thoſe who are near, to come yet nearer, that He is <hi>diſallowed indeed of men.</hi> 10. Chriſt is diſallowed, when he is not fled to, and made uſe of, for that life and reſt, and other advantages to be had in Him: for, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Believers coming to Him, and uſe-making of Him, He is ſaid to be <hi>diſallowed indeed of men.</hi> 11. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, not only as He is God, but as He is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, is, and hath been from eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. the Father's choice and delight, in higheſt eſteem with Him; which is evidenced by the Father's giving all things into His hand for our good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. and all for that very end, that He may be honourable in our eſteem, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. by His hearing of Him as our Interceſſour in all His petitions, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.42. and hearing all our lawfull deſires for His ſake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. and by the unſpeakable terrour which He will manifeſt againſt rejecters of Him, beyond what other ſinners ſhall find, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. All which do prove, that as our Mediatour, He is moſt dear and precious to the Father, and worthy is He to be ſo, there being none in heaven or in earth fit for that work of Redemption but He, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.4, 5. Therefore is He <hi>choſen of God, and precious.</hi> 12. The Father's high eſteem of, and delighting in, the Mediatour Chriſt, ſhould move ſinners to come to Him, to chooſe Him for their portion, and to delight in Him, being confident that their ſo doing cannot but be well-pleaſing to the Father, who hath choſen Him that He may welcom ſinners, and hath fitted Him to be all things to them that may contribute for their bleſſedneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. for, this is a motive of coming to Him, that He is <hi>choſen of God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:105751:37"/>From <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt's way of engaging the hearts of His own to a daily uſe-making of Him, is by propoſing to them, in His Word, the ſweet advantages, and rich priviledges, which they ſhall have by their ſo doing: with the conſideration whereof, he allows them to move their own hearts to perſeverance in that exerciſe: for, this Verſe doth contain a bundle of advantages and priviledges, that ſouls have by daily uſe-making of Chriſt, branched out to move them thereunto, to wit, That by their coming to Him, as to a living ſtone, <hi>they alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Every renewed act of Faith, cloſing with Chriſt, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holds Him forth, doth draw from Chriſt ſome new increaſe of ſpiritual life, whereby the ſoul is made more ſenſible of ſin, hath more appetite after Chriſt and His Truth, and more activity in duties that may honour Him; all which, are effects of ſpiritual life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances betwixt it and the natural life: for, this is here made a prevailing motive to that coming to Chriſt, which is recommended to ſinners in the former Verſe, that they who did ſo, ſhould be made <hi>lively ſtones,</hi> which muſt be underſtood of an increaſe of ſpiritual life, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken to them, who are ſuppoſed before to have been born again. 3. Even as Believers are holden throng in daily employing, and uſe-making of Chriſt, ſo do they make progreſs in grace and holineſs, ſo do they alſo become ſolid, and fixed in their underſtanding of the Truth, that they may not be carried about with every wind of doctrine, conſtant in their love to Chriſt, and in their believing of His love to them, and eſtabliſhed in their walking like unto His Truths: for, in oppoſition to the unſetledneſs of miſ-believers, and of them who do not live in the daily imploying of Chriſt, but reſt upon their meaſures received, thoſe that are daily coming to Him, are here ſaid to be <hi>lively ſtones, built up, &amp;c.</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, beſide their progreſs, a ſtate of ſtability and fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they attain to by their ſo doing. 4. The lively and frequent exerciſe of Faith, draweth vertue
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105751:38"/>
from Chriſt to make the Believer reſemble Him in thoſe communicable perfections of His, wherewith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holds Him forth adorned, and to be cloſed with by ſinners, ſo that under whatſoever conſideration of Chriſt held forth in Scripture, ſinners do cloſe with Him, they are thereby in ſome meaſure changed to ſome likeneſs with Him in that conſideration: if the unclean ſoul cloſe with Him, offered under the conſideration of a fountain, it becomes in ſome meaſure like Him in purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; if the dead ſinner receive Him, offered as life, he becomes to live like Him; if the unſtable ſoul come to Him, as the foundation-ſtone, it grows ſtable as a ſtone: and ſo of every conſideration, under which Chriſt offered in the Word is cloſed with: for, He being before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed under the conſideration of a living ſtone, as the object of Faith to be cloſed with, the Apoſtle here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that they who did ſo cloſe with Him, ſhould find that by their ſo doing, they <hi>alſo as lively ſtones ſhould be built up.</hi> 5. Thoſe ſouls, who may expect that the Lord will keep communion with them, and dwell familiarly in them, as in His Houſe, muſt labour to be made ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, in their minds enlightened, and elevated to diſcern things ſpiritual, which the natural man cannot do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.12. in their affections humbled in the ſenſe of their unworthineſs and ſinfulneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their acceptation with God through Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.3. chearfull in Him as reconciled to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.3. loathing ſin, and loving holineſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all perſons that are holy, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. All which the Scriptures cited make clear to be parts of a ſpiritual frame, which is to be ſtudied by all thoſe who may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Lord to dwell in them, as in His Houſe: for, Believers, in order to their enjoying of fellowſhip with Chriſt, are here ſaid to <hi>be built up a ſpiritual houſe.</hi> 6. The more heartily and frequently ſinners flee to, and make uſe of, Jeſus Chriſt, as the Goſpel offers Him, the more fit are they to be an habitation for Him to dwell in, and the more familiarly will He converſe with them; and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105751:38"/>
that becauſe the only way to attain to, and grow in, a ſpiritual frame, which makes ſinners a fit habitation for the Lord to dwell in, is to be daily flying to, and making uſe of Jeſus Chriſt, who gives the Spirit for working of that frame, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. for, Believers by coming to Him, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. are here ſaid to be <hi>built up a ſpiritual houſe.</hi> 7. Near union with Jeſus Chriſt and daily uſe-making of Him by Faith, is the beſt way to make the Saints one among themſelves: the diviſion, difference of judgment, and alienation of affection among them proves one or other, or all of them to be at a diſtance from Him: for, while the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To whom coming, &amp;c. Ye are built up a ſpiritual houſe,</hi> he doth import, That Believers by their cloſing with, and uſe-making of Jeſus Chriſt, are as cloſely united one of them to another, as the ſtones of a building are. 3. Every particular Believer ſhould eſteem himſelf a part of the Church univerſal, which maketh up one houſe to God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. and ſo ſhould ſeek the good thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.9. and ſympathize with the ſufferings of the whole, or any member thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25, 26. ſeing <hi>they are built up,</hi> (to wit, in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, with the reſt of the members thereof) <hi>a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual houſe.</hi> 9. Although the moſt eminent Believers may not take upon them any part of the Miniſterial Office, without a lawful and orderly calling thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 4. yet all Profeſſours of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do in ſome reſpects reſemble the Prieſts under the Law, in ſo far as they are ſeparated by the Lord from all the reſt of the world; and true Believers among them do receive that unction from the Lord, to wit, His holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. which was ſignified by that oyl wherewith the Prieſts were anointed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.41. and have their ſervice accepted, while others are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. in which reſpects they are here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>An holy Prieſthood.</hi> 10. Although internal, or real holineſs be not the neceſſary qualification, which maketh one a member of the viſible Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. Yet is it the duty of all to ſtudy that holineſs, and the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105751:39"/>
mark of all the true and lively members of the Church to be endued therewith: therefore they are here called, <hi>A holy Priesthood.</hi> 11. The great imployment of Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, is, to offer ſacrifices to God, not typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, which are now aboliſhed by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor expiatory, which Chriſt alone hath once offered, never to be repeated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. but <hi>gratulatory,</hi> in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their thankfulneſs to Him, for that ſacrifice of Himſelf for them, ſuch as the ſacrifice of themſelves for His ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. their penitent and humble ſupplications, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. and 141.2. their praiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. and their charity to his Saints, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.18. Theſe and the like are they to ofter, who are <hi>a holy Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices.</hi> 12. What ever ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of this ſort Believers offer up to God, they muſt be ſpiritual, done from a ſpiritual principle, a new nature, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. upon ſpiritual furniture, the ſtrength of Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.13. and for a ſpiritual end, the glory of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. In which and the like reſpects, they are here called <hi>ſpiritual ſacrifices.</hi> 13. Such ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſacrifices as Believers offer up to God, are well-pleaſing to Him, not for any worth that is in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. or advantage they can be to Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25. But becauſe they are preſented to God by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who taketh away the iniquity of their holy things, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. and doth perfume their ſervice with the incenſe of his merits, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. Therefore are their ſacrifices <hi>acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle doth confirm his former Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſefulneſs and excellency of Jeſus Chriſt for the Church and Believers in Him, by a teſtimony of Scripture, which (though no particular place be here cited) is to be found, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. And withall, he adds
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105751:39"/>
two further arguments to move them to that hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Goſpel, and uſe-making of Chriſt offered in it, which he hath preſt in the former words: The one is, That we have Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Father's choice, and highly eſteemed by Him, with the Father's great good will, laid in the Church as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and chief corner-ſtone thereof, for every ſoul to flee to, and reſt upon. The other is, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever betake themſelves to Him by Faith, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver need to be aſhamed of their ſo doing. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Miniſters of Chriſt ought to have the written Word ſo richly dwelling in them, that they may be able to confirm every Truth they deliver from that Word; and the Lord's People ought to be ſo well acquainted with the ſame, that though Miniſters do not ſpend time to cite particularly every Chapter and Verſe, where every paſſage they bring forth is to be found, they may notwithſtanding, upon the hearing of it, faithfully and for the ſubſtance repeated to them, acknowledge and receive the ſame for the Lord's mind: for, even the Apoſtle here, as frequently elſwhere, doth confirm his Doctrine by Scripture; and yet, ſupponing thoſe to whom he writes well acquainted, at leaſt with the letter thereof, he doth not condeſcend upon the particular place, judging it ſufficient to ſay, <hi>Wherefore it is contained in the Scripture, Behold, I lay, &amp;c.</hi> 2. True Faith can have ſolid footing no where but upon the written Word of God, nor ſhould any of the Lord's People be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the moſt pleaſant notions about Chriſt Jeſus, till they ſee them grounded upon, and drawn from, that Word: therfore the Apoſtle, having in the former words commended Chriſt, as the object of ſaving Faith, doth here repeat again the ſame commendation of Him from the Old Teſtament, that ſo Faith might reſt ſafely upon Him as ſuch a one; <hi>Wherefore it is contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-ſtone. &amp;c.</hi> 3. Jeſus Chriſt, and He alone, is that to the Church, and to every ſoul that flees to Him, which the chief corner ſtone,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105751:40"/>
whether the loweſt or the higheſt, is to the building: He is the ſtone firſt laid, in regard He was and behoved to be actually exerciſing His Mediatory Office, before any ſinner could attain to union or communion with God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. He is the ſtone, laid lower than any of the reſt in His humiliation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6. He bears the weight of the whole Church, and of every believing ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. He is more curiouſly wrought than any of the reſt of the ſtones of the building (as the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone uſeth to be) and engraven by the art of His Father, adorning Him with all perfections ſuitable for the neceſſities of poor ſinners, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.9. He is the bond, whereby moſt differing Nations, ſuch as <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> are united in one building, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16. as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation corner-ſtone knits the two ſide-walls of the building together; He is the perfection of the whole, in whom the building, and every lively ſtone thereof is compleat, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. as the higheſt corner-ſtone, and as that alſo, He is the glory and ornament of all the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.24. In all which He is reſembled by that, whereby the Spirit of the Lord here ſets Him forth to our capacity, <hi>The chief corner-ſtone.</hi> 4. We have this great bleſſing, Chriſt for the chief corner-ſtone of this ſpiritual building, with the Father's great good will, who hath laid Him, firſt, In His eternal Counſel or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as the word uſed by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 28.16. and here tranſlated <hi>to lay,</hi> doth ſignifie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. Secondly, In His actual exhibition of Him to the Church as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: firſt, in the promiſe of Him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5. and next, viſibly in our fleſh; for, ſo this word is alſo uſed, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the publiſhing or execution of things formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.19. And thirdly, in His exalting of Him, when He had perfected the work of Redemption, ſo much of it as concerned Him to do in the ſtate of his humiliation: for, ſo this ſame word, (uſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.2.) is tranſlated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.16. to perfect a work. In all which reſpects, the Father layes Chriſt the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or chief corner-ſtone, in the Church; and calls
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105751:40"/>
all to behold what pleaſure He hath in ſo doing: <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-ſtone.</hi> 5. The Father's conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency to give His own bleſſed Son, for the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned uſes to His Church, and Believers in Him, which this ſimilitude, here made uſe of, holds forth, is worthy of our moſt ſerious conſideration; and Chriſt, this chief corner-ſtone, is much to be admired, as differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all other corner-ſtones, He being one ſtone, who is both the loweſt and higheſt of the building, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6, 7. who hath immediate connexion with the leaſt ſtone, or meaneſt Believer, as well as with the greateſt or moſt eminent, whether Prophets, Apoſtles, or even the virgin <hi>Mary, Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21. who communicates an influence of life and growth, to every ſtone laid upon Him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21. and who never ſuffers any that are built upon Him to fall totally and finally off Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. In all which reſpects we are here called to admire Jeſus Chriſt, and to give our moſt ſerious attention and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to the Father in giving Him, by this word, which ſerves both to draw attention and admiration; <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-ſtone, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Though Chriſt be God's gift to the whole Church, made up of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Eph.</hi> 2.14. which often hath the name of <hi>Sion</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Obad.</hi> 17. Yet with a ſpecial refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who firſt had that name, He is ſaid to be laid in <hi>Sion,</hi> being firſt preached publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and held forth in Promiſes, Sacrifices, and Types to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. being come of them according to the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. and firſt offered to them after His incarnation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5, 6. from whom the news of Him is come to the reſt of the world, <hi>Mica.</hi> 4.2. and by whom Chriſt ſhall yet have a great part of His publick glory in the world, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12, 15. All which ſhould make us pity their preſent caſe, and pray for their converſion: for, with a ſpecial eye to them is this ſpoken, <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-ſtone &amp;c.</hi> 7. Chriſt's fitneſs for this great work of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, evidenced by the Father's chooſing of Him for it,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105751:41"/>
from among all others, as the word <hi>elect</hi> ſignifies, and by His high eſteem of Him as our Mediator, ſhould ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw the hearts of ſinners in to Him, and move them to dwell much upon the thoughts of His worth, and of the Father's eſteem of Him, as He is the receiver of all that come to God through Him: for, the Apoſtle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commended Chriſt before, from theſe two Epithits, that He is <hi>choſen of God,</hi> and <hi>precious,</hi> as motives to draw ſinners in to Him, repeateth them here again, as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to write and think of ſo ſweet a ſubject as Chriſt; <hi>Elect, precious.</hi> 8. That which builds ſinners upon Chriſt, this chief corner-ſtone, is that grace of believing, which, according to the ſignification of the word in the Hebrew, whence the Apoſtle tranſlateth this Text, is, the fixedneſs, or ſtayedneſs (as this ſame word is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.12.) of the ſoul in the expectation of ſalvation through Chriſt, offered in the Goſpel; and whereby the ſoul is fed and nouriſhed upon Him, as its neceſſary food, which is alſo in the ſignification of the word in that Language: for, the Apoſtle, inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting further upon the metaphor of a building, which would have required him to ſay, he that is built upon Him, ſhall not be aſhamed, ſpeaketh properly, expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it is to be built upon Him, to wit, to cloſe with Him by Faith; <hi>He that believeth on Him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> 9. Patient waiting on God, in the uſe of His means, for the performance of His promiſes, without ſuch haſting to a delivery as makes us faint or fret under the delay thereof, or uſe unlawful means for attaining to it, is the kindly effect of ſaving Faith, and that which keepeth off ſhame and confuſion, which ſuch haſtineſs occaſioneth to the Lord's People: for, the Apoſtle, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating theſe words of <hi>Iſaiah, He that believeth maketh not haſt,</hi> expreſſeth the effect of not haſting in the aforeſaid ſenſe to be this, <hi>He that believeth on Him ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle, having commended Chriſt, that ſinners might be moved to make uſe of Him, as the Goſpel of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Him, doth here hold forth the dignity and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that believe in Him; as alſo the diſpoſition, and judgment of all that reject Him, that ſo none might ſtumble or be diſcouraged, when they ſee Him rejected by ſo many. As for Believers, Chriſt is an honour to them, and they have a high eſteem of Him: both which readings, the original words, in the beginning of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Verſe will bear. And as for others, who will not be perſwaded to believe and obey the Goſpel, that ſtone, Jeſus Chriſt the Mediatour, whom the Rulers of His time ſet at nought, is exalted by the Father (according to the Pſalmiſt's word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22. which the Apoſtle here rehearſes) to be the glorious Head of the Church and Believers, and a terror to all, whoſe blind and carnal hearts, do ſtill find out ſomething in the Goſpel, whence they take occaſion to reject Chriſt, and refuſe to take on his yoke; and thereby do but ruine themſelves, as a mad man that daſhes himſelf againſt a ſtone in his way; or, fooliſh Mariners, that run their ſhip againſt a rock, which are the ſimilitudes here made uſe of, taken out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. and ſo do prove themſelves to be Reprobates. Which purpoſe contains three further motives to preſſe that hearty receiving of the Word, and uſe-making of Chriſt offered in it, which the Apoſtle hath recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the former words: every one of which motives, ſerve to guard againſt the offence that might ariſe from wicked mens rejecting of Chriſt. The firſt is, That Chriſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105751:42"/>
Jeſus is an honour to all that believe in Him. The ſecond is, That his glory is nothing diminiſhed by others reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Him, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. And the third, is, That they who continue ſo to do, will but run themſelves upon that ruine, to which they have been from eternity appointed, for their rejecting of an offered Saviour, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Learn,</hi> Chriſt is the true honour of all that truly believe in him; He is a great credit to all his poor kinred, who are honoured by him, not only to ſerve him, but to be ſerved by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. and by his beſt Servants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. to be made Sons of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. to have a marriage-relation to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. to be heirs and co-heirs of glory with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. and it doth not yet appear, but we ſhall know it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward how much is in this word, which in the Original is in the abſtract, and runneth thus, <hi>Chriſt is an honour to you that believe.</hi> 2. Jeſus Chriſt is moſt dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to all that truly believe in him, he being their life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. their light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. their wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. their food, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.56. their raiment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. and every thing to them which is moſt neceſſary; and conſequently moſt precious to the children of men: and therefore cannot but be in ſo high eſteem with them, that the very thoughts of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.17. his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and excellent to them; and their moſt precious things in this world, cannot be dear to them, for his ſake, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24. but muſt be dung and loſſe that they may gain him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8. And this eſteem of Chriſt, where ever it is, in any real meaſure, is a clear mark of true and ſaving Faith: for, ſo much is expreſſed in our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the word, <hi>Unto you that believe he is precious.</hi> 3. It is our clear up-taking of Chriſt in his excellency and uſefulneſs for ſinners, as the Word reveals him, and ſome experimental feeling upon our cloſing with him, that he is ſuch a one to us, which begets this precious eſteem of him in the hearts of Believers: we can never eſteem of him, till we know how excellent an one he is,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105751:42"/>
and taſt in ſome meaſure how gracious he is: for, of thoſe, whom the Apoſtle ſupponeth to know Chriſt in ſome meaſure, as he is formerly deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. and to have taſted how gracious he is, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. he affirms here, <hi>Unto you therefore which believe he is precious.</hi> 4. They who do not believe in, and eſteem highly of Jeſus Chriſt, they are not only guilty of neglecting and ſlighting of him, (the hazard whereof is unſpeakable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.) but they are alſo guilty of high rebellion and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God; it being one of his greateſt and moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Commands, to believe in his Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. and to honour him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. Without obedience to which, it is not poſſible to give any acceptable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to any other of his Commands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. There is no midſt betwixt theſe two, men muſt either believe in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have a precious eſteem of him, or be diſobedient and rebellious as the word ſignifieth: Therefore the Apoſtle thus expreſſeth that diſpoſition, in oppoſition to believing and a precious eſteem of Chriſt, <hi>Them which be diſobedient.</hi> 5. Although Jeſus Chriſt, in his dealing with ſouls, hath the ſtrongeſt reaſons upon his ſide that ever were uſed with any, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and great variety of moſt alluring motives to gain ſouls to his obedience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet there are a great many who are ſo adicted to their own will and luſts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. that they will not ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded by him, either to receive information to their minds from him, or to admit that he ſhould reform their hearts and lives: for, this deſcription of the wicked, doth deſign perſons that have been by ſtrong reaſons and alluring motives dealt with, but have ſhewen themſelves a verſe from all yeelding or perſwaſion; <hi>But unto them which be diſobedient.</hi> 6. Thoſe whom God hath placed in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in, or over his Church (and who are obliged to Chriſt for their place and power more than others, not only to build themſelves by Faith upon him, but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their wit &amp; power to draw many others in to him, and one of them to work to anothers hand, like ſo many
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105751:43"/>
builders in the advancement of his work) are too often found oppoſers of his work, and rejecters of himſelf, as if he were unworthy to be laid as a ſtone in their buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or that his intereſt ſhould be minded in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: for, thoſe who were in Authority in Chriſt's time, are deſigned by this name of <hi>Builders,</hi> to which they ſhould have been anſwerable, but it was not ſo: <hi>Christ was the ſtone which the builders diſallowed.</hi> 7. The higher any be ſet in eminency of power or place above others, the more doth the Lord reſent and take notice of their rejecting of him, and oppoſing of his work: for, though many of the common people among the <hi>Jews,</hi> did reject Chriſt, for which they bear their judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.38. Yet this guilt, is mainly charged upon the Rulers: <hi>The ſtone which the builders diſallowed.</hi> 8. Chriſt, our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, will not be the leſſe honourable, nor will his glory be any whit diminiſhed, that many, and thoſe the chief among men, do reject him and ſlight him, But rather that will tend to his greater glory; the Father taking occaſion by their ſo doing, to let out the more of his grace and love to his own Church and People that imbrace him; and to illuſtrate his juſtice the more, in the ruine of rejecters of him: for, while Chriſt is diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of the builders, What comes of him? For the comfort and glory of his Church, <hi>He becomes the head of the corner;</hi> and for the terror and ruine of his enemies, <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

                  <p>After the deſcription of the wofull eſtate of them that ſlight Chriſt, the Apoſtle returneth again to illuſtrate further the excellency of the ſtate of true Believers, to whom theſe honourable titles, which the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed of old upon the viſible Church of the <hi>Jews, Exod.</hi> 19.6. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7. (and ſo may yet in ſome ſenſe be ſafely applied to all viſible Profeſſors) do moſt fully and truly agree: for, ſpeaking to all the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who were Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, he affirmeth, firſt, That they were wailed out from among the reſt of the world: which is true of all of them, in ſo far as they were made Members of the chriſtian Church; and of ſome of them, in a more ſpecial way, in ſo far as they were made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his ſpecial grace and love; and ſo they were a <hi>choſen Generation.</hi> Secondly, That they did partake of the benefits of Chriſt's Kingly and Prieſtly Office, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105751:44"/>
did, in ſome reſpects, reſemble him in the exerciſe of both, in ſo far as all of them, were profeſſed, and ſome of them, true ſubjects of Chriſt, the King of the Church: all of them were by profeſſion, and ſome of them in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling, ſeparated from the world for his ſervice: and had ſpiritual priviledges, anſwerable to theſe of Kings and Prieſts; and ſo were a <hi>Royal Prieſthood.</hi> Thirdly, That they were all of them federally holy, and ſome of them endued with true ſanctification; and ſo were a <hi>holy Nation.</hi> Fourthly, That all of them, who did externally ſubject themſelves to Chriſt, were owned by him, as his propriety and prime intereſt, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the reſt of the world; and true Believers among them, as his Elect and Redeemed Ones; and ſo were a <hi>peculiar People.</hi> And all for this end, that they might in their practice commend and expreſs his properties, to his praiſe, who had called all of them externally, and ſome of them effectually, out of the ſtate of ſin and wrath, to a ſtate of favour and happineſs. Which purpoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth two further arguments to preſs a hearty receiving of the Goſpel, and daily uſe-making of Chriſt offered in it, in order to their ſpiritual growth; The one, taken from the excellency of their preſent eſtate, in the ſeveral fore-mentioned particulars; The other, from that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change, which God had made upon them, from ſo wofull, to ſo bleſſed a condition. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is very ſafe, and ſuitable to Scripture-language, to give unto the whole viſible Church, and all the Profeſſours within the ſame, theſe ſtiles and compellations, which do only agree in their full and beſt ſignification to true Believers: Suppoſe the moſt part within the viſible Church, void of ſaving grace; yet, in reſpect of the reſt of the world, and by vertue of that Covenant which is betwixt the Lord and her, and all her Members, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 29.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all Profeſſors may, in ſome ſenſe, have all the ſtiles that are here in the Text, and others like them: for, though theſe ſtiles be moſt truly verified in Believers; Yet, did the Lord of old give them
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105751:45"/>
unto the whole Church of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and the Apoſtle here, giveth them indefinitly to all the nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were profeſſours of Chriſt, to whom he writeth, though with a ſpecial eye to thoſe who were true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers among them; <hi>Ye are a choſen Generation, &amp;c.</hi> 2. So excellent is that ſtate, whereunto ſinners are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, by believing in Jeſus Chriſt, that the ſharpeſt ſighted in the world, the longer they look upon it, will ſtill ſee more and more of the excellency and priviledges thereof: The diſcovery whereof to the Lord's People, eſpecially while they are under affliction, ſhould much take up the heart and pains of all the Miniſters of Chriſt, it being his peoples prime comfort under all their croſſes, and their chief motive to all their duties, that they are in ſo excellent a ſpiritual ſtate: for, after the Apoſtle hath largely deſcribed it in the former Chapter, and ſpoken much of it in the former part of this, he cometh yet again upon the branching out of it here; <hi>But ye are a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſthood, &amp;c.</hi> All which ſtiles, do moſt truly agree to true Believers. 3. They who do by Faith chooſe Jeſus Chriſt for their portion, who entertain in their hearts a high eſteem of him, and do make uſe of him daily for growth in grace and holineſs, They have the characters and marks of ſuch as have been from eternity elected of God, and in time effectually called, there being no other ordinary way to evidence the latter to us but by the former, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. for, of Election and effectual calling in reference to true Believers, may this be underſtood, which here the Apoſtle affirmeth of thoſe to whom he ſaid before, that Chriſt was precious; <hi>But ye are a choſen Generation.</hi> 4. As that dignity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſinners are advanced by flying to Jeſus Chriſt, doth, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, reſemble that of the Prieſts under the Law (as was cleared in the tenth Doctrine upon the fifth Verſe;) So are they alſo thereby brought unto a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignity; and in a ſpiritual ſenſe, they only are truly royal, having a new nature in ſome meaſure reſembling the divine, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. being co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105751:45"/>
(<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.) of a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. and more than conquerors over all their ſpiritual enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. In all which, and the like reſpects, they are a <hi>Royal Prieſthood.</hi> 5. Our union with Jeſus doth not only oblige us to keep a diſtance from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and profane faſhions of the men, whoſe portion is in this earth, and to conſecrate our ſelves wholly for the Lords uſe in the ſtudy of holineſs; but likewiſe it doth really make Believers a holy People: In ſo far as he is daily made uſe of by Faith, their hearts are purged from the love of their luſts, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. and they are made to exerciſe other graces and duties of holineſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is honoured, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. for, this third branch of the commendation of their excellent ſtate, includeth both their duty and their priviledge, They are <hi>a holy Nation.</hi> 6. As all the people on earth are the Lords, they being all the works of his hand, and under the diſpoſal of his providence, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26. and all the Members of the Church viſible, are His in a more peculiar way than others, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. So Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, are in a moſt ſpecial way his propriety and peculiar intereſt, whom he hath purchaſed to himſelf at a dear rate, <hi>Act.</hi> 20 28. and made new again by a ſecond creation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. in whom he doth delight, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. and whom alſo he will maintain and never forſake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.14. for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the fourth branch of the dignity of his People, which doth in ſome ſenſe agree to the whole company of Profeſſours, and moſt truly to true Believers, that they are <hi>a peculiar People.</hi> 7. That which is the Lords end in beſtowing all theſe priviledges upon Believers, and which they ſhould make the great end and buſineſs of their life, is, That they may ſhew forth the praiſes of the Lord, by numbering out (as the Hebrew word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43: 21. which the Apoſtle here tranſlateth, doth ſignifie) to the Lord himſelf his bleſſed perfections, or vertues (as the word here, rendred <hi>praiſes,</hi> is in the original) or rather by their prudent and ſeaſonable commending to others his properties, ſuch as his Wiſdom, Power, Terror, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105751:46"/>
Faithfulneſs, manifeſted in his dealing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo others may be ſtirred up to ſerve him, and praiſe him; but eſpecially by their expreſſing and holding forth in their practiſe ſome reſemblance of his properties to his praiſe, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.15, 16. by their prudent and wiſe carriage, declaring to on-lookers, that he is moſt wiſe, by whoſe counſel they are guided; by their hazarding upon affliction, rather than ſin; demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating his terror, to be above the terror of fleſh; and by their patience, and chearfulneſs under croſſes and trials, proclaming to diſcerning beholders that his power is great, that ſuſtains them; and his conſolations ſweet, that do refreſh their hearts under ſuch afflictions, and make up the bitterneſs of them: for, this is here ſet down as the end of all the fore-mentioned priviledges, and the compend of Believers duty, <hi>that they ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him.</hi> 8. Even the Elect, before converſion, are living in groſſe ignorance of their own miſerable condition, and the remedy thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. in the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12.

All which, in Scripture, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſet out by this word <hi>darkneſs,</hi> whereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expreſſeth the ſtate of the Elect before converſion. 9. Converſion brings ſinners into a ſtate of light, which comprehends ſome clear knowledge of their own miſery, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. and the remedy thereof, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. a new and ſpiritual life communicated to them, whereby they are enabled to cloſe with Chriſt and cleave unto him, <hi>Joh,</hi> 18.12. to walk in holineſs of life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. their living in his favour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15. their having a right to glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. and his allowance to rejoyce and comfort themſelves in their bleſſed eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. All which are ſet forth in Scripture by this word, whereby the Apoſtle expreſſeth the excellent ſtate of Converted Ones, <hi>Who are called out of darkneſs into his light.</hi> 10. The bleſſed eſtate of true Converts, is much to be admired by them, conſidering the Lords wonderful condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105751:46"/>
in plucking them out of ſo woful a condition as they were in before; his marvellous loving kindneſs, in poſſeſſing them in ſuch excellent priviledges, as they have in their new ſtate; and giving them an undoubted right to ſo matchleſs an inheritance, as cannot but ſurpaſs the power of their underſtanding to comprehend, and ſo make them wonder at their own happineſs, which is here called <hi>marvellous light.</hi> 11. The way how the Lord brings his own out of the ſtate of nature, which is here called <hi>darkneſs,</hi> into the ſtate of grace, which is called <hi>light,</hi> is, by his calling of them by the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.14. opening their hearts to receive it, by the power of his Spirit comming along with it, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. and ſo powerfully changing them into his own Image, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Who hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> 12. Theſe upon whom the Lord hath wrought this bleſſed change, ought frequently to reflect upon their former woful ſtate, that they may be kept humble, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9. and compaſſionate to others, who are yet in the like, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2, 3. and likewiſe upon their preſent bleſſed condition, that they may be provoked to praiſe, and to the ſtudy of holineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 17. for which, and the like cauſes, the change of Believers from the one ſtate to the other, is here repreſented to their thoughts, <hi>that they might ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105751:47"/>
had ſaving and ſpecial mercies offered to all of them, and beſtowed upon ſome of them, So that <hi>Hoſea's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, (<hi>chap.</hi> 2.23.) concerning the reſtoring of the Jewiſh Nation, after their rejection for a time, had now a begun accompliſhment in them; eſpecially, in thoſe of them who had felt the fore-mentioned remarkable change, whereby they ſhould be moved to live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the praiſe of him that made it.

When the Lord ſpeaks to his Church in one age, or to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons in it, he doth often ſpeak alſo to his Church in after-ages, and to all the reſt of his People who are to live afterward.

They that would delight in ſhewing forth the praiſes of God, and have their hearts engaged to the ſtudy of holineſs, muſt learn to dwell upon the thoughts of their wofull caſe, wherein they were before converſion; and upon the bleſſed ſtate whereunto, through Gods mercy, they are advanced: and often to compare the one with the other, that ſo they may be the more affected with the change, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſtudy his honour that made it: for, after the Apoſtle had in the former Verſe repreſented this to their thoughts, as a motive to holineſs, he doth here inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and repreſent the ſame again by a new enlargement of it, (which is mainly verified in true Converts) <hi>Who in time paſt were not a people, but are now the people of

God, &amp;c.</hi> Although the elect be the Lord's People from eternity in regard of his purpoſe of grace toward them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. Yet, in regard of any actual manifeſtation of ſpecial love to them, or of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in them as carrying his Image, they are not his People; but remain ſlaves to Satan, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. and to their own luſts, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. until ſuch time as by his power, put forth with the preaching of the Law, their wofull caſe be diſcovered to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. and by the ſame power, coming along with the preaching of the Goſpel, they be made willing to accept the offer of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. and thereby alſo be fitted for the duties of new obedience for the honour of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. All which, as the places cited prove, are marks of them whom he doth in a ſpecial way own for his People: for, of the choſen Generation the Apoſtle thus ſpeaketh, in reference to their ſtate before and after converſion; <hi>VVhich in time paſt were not a people, but are now the people of God.</hi> 4. Though there be not a ſinner in the world, who hath not many mercies of God freely beſtowed upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. and many deſerved ſtrokes kept off him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3.

The cloſing of ſinners by Faith with Jeſus Chriſt, as the Goſpel offers him to them, doth bring them to a moſt ſweet and excellent ſtate, namely, to be owned and dealt with by the Lord as his People, in a moſt ſpecial manner, whom he will never forſake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.14. and to obtain mercy of him for pardoning their daily ſinfulneſs, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.18. for pitying, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, as is fitting, all their neceſſities, as the word here tranſlated, to <hi>obtain mercy</hi> ſignifies; and for bearing them

of one motive upon the back of another, to ſtir them up to that exerciſe: for, even theſe whom the Apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to have made ſome progreſs in mortification, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and whom he had exhorted to further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs therein, in the firſt Verſe of this Chapter, he doth here again exhort very earneſtly to the ſame by ſeveral arguments, <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you abſtain from fleſhly luſts, &amp;c.</hi> 2. True mortification of ſin, conſiſteth not only in abſtenance from the outward acts thereof, but in the weakning of the root and power of ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the inclinations and deſires of the ſoul after the acting thereof, which are here called <hi>fleſhly luſts,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they tend to the gratifying and pleaſing of the fleſh, and are acted by the outward man, <hi>abſtain from fleſhly luſts.</hi> 3. The beſt way for Believers to fit themſelves for the ſhewing forth of the praiſes of God in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, is, To ſet about the mortifying of thoſe motions and inclinations to ſin that remain in their heart, theſe being the cauſe of all the out-breakings which diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in their converſation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. for, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, may ſafely be taken as the mean of attaining to that which is the great end of Chriſtians calling, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the former Verſe, That they may ſhew forth his praiſe, they muſt <hi>abſtain from fleſhly luſts.</hi> 4. The love of the Lord, manifeſted toward ſinners, ſhould be a very ſtrong argument to move them to fight againſt theſe luſts which diſhonour him, and mar the ſenſe of his love, and the further manifeſtation thereof: for, this ſtile, <hi>Dearly beloved,</hi> may be taken as an argument to the duty preſt, and underſtood mainly of the love of God to his People: becauſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 9.25.) citing the place, which this Apoſtle cited immediatly before, doth find in it this ſtile in reference to God: and therefore this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle may be conceived to make uſe of it here in the ſame ſenſe, as a motive to the ſtudy of mortification. <hi>Dearly beloved, abſtain, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Thoſe who preſſe people to the mortifying of their beloved luſts, had need not only to entertain much love to them in their hearts, that ſo they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105751:49"/>
may deal earneſtly with them; but likewiſe, by ſome prudent expreſſions of their love to them, inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their affections, that ſo the ſtirring of their paſſions (which are ready to riſe, when unmortified corruptions are touched, both in good, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.10. and bad, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.4, 5.) may be prevented: Therfore, the Apoſtle breaths forth his affection to this People, which may be ſafely taken to be alſo comprehended in this compellation, as following after Chriſt, and moving the Apoſtle to much earneſtneſs, <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you abstain, &amp;c.</hi> 6. As it may be the lot of thoſe, who in regard of their right to the Covenant of Grace, and the benefits thereof, are no more ſtrangers and foreiners, but fellow-citizens of the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God, to be ſeparated from their native Country, as theſe Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews</hi> were, to whom this is ſpoken; So, what ever their condition in the world be, they ought to eſteem and confeſs themſelves (as the beſt of God's Saints have done, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.) ſtrangers and pilgrims, who are abſent from their own Country, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. and may expect hard uſage in their way, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.15. who ought to lay aſide every thing that may hinder them in their journey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. and have their hearts ſtill homward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. who ſhould take little pleaſure in the delights that offer themſelves in the courſe of their pilgrimage. <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.4. and eſteem it a great honour to get leave to do any piece of ſervice to God, while they are upon their journey, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.15. and ſhould count much of any mercifull providence they meet with, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.10. and make their caſe an argument to God for his pity and kindneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.19. and a motive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to abſtain from every thing that may hinder them in their journey homward: for, this is brought in by the Apoſtle, as an argument to all the duties of holineſs, and eſpecially, to the ſtudy of mortification, that they were <hi>ſtrangers and pilgrims.</hi> 7. The inward motions of unmortified corruptions, which are in the Godly, do not only fight againſt the welfare of their bodies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.

But likewiſe againſt the everlaſting wel-being of their very ſouls, ſo that theſe corruptions cannot be given way to, except we would (ſo far as in us lyes) run the hazard of the loſſe of our ſouls: for, this is here a third motive to the mortifying of theſe luſts, that they <hi>war against the ſoul.</hi> 8. The Lord doth allow Chriſtians to ſtir up their hearts to the ſtudy of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of their corruptions, by the conſideration of the hazard that cannot but follow upon their prevailing, which is no leſſe than the wounding of their ſouls by every advantage their corruptions do get; and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal loſſe and ruine of their ſouls, by the continual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of them, as is imported alſo in this motive to the mortification of thoſe fleſhly luſts; <hi>They war againſt the ſoul.</hi>

The firſt, is, That their lot was to converſe among the enemies of the Goſpel, and ſuch as would be glad to find occaſion from their miſcarriage to ſlander them as evil doers. The ſecond, is, That their holy walking among ſuch, might prove a bleſſed mean, not only to ſtop the mouthes of their ſlanderous enemies; but likewiſe to being about their converſion, and conſequently bring much glory to God, when it ſhould pleaſe him to viſit them with his ſaving grace.

It is not ſo much by a fair profeſſion, or good expreſſions, that Chriſtians do ſhew forth the praiſes of God, as by an <hi>honest converſation,</hi> made beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and lovely (as the word here tranſlated <hi>honeſt</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth) to on-lookers, by the right ordering of all the parts of it in duties to God and men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23. by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of wiſdom and meekneſs therein joyntly, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.13. and eſpecially, by the faithful diſcharge of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their particular callings and relations, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9, 10. for, the way of the Apoſtle's bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this exhortation, giveth ground to take this as an mean of attaining to what he had preſt before, to wit, their ſhewing forth of the praiſes of God, mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>having your converſation honeſt, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The more wicked the ſociety be, with whom Believers lot is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the more ſhould they be ſtirred up to the ſtudy of an honeſt converſation, for the conviction or gaining of ſuch: for, by this that theſe Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews</hi> were among Heathens (whom many profeſſors of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reſemble, in living like Heathens without reſpect to the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. purſuing ſtrongly their Idols, as Heathens do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. and being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the priviledges and duties of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as Heathens are, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11. and ready to perſecute all that run not their courſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. All which, the Scriptures cited, make characters of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens) the Apoſtle perſwades them to ſtudy holineſs of life: <hi>having your converſation honeſt among the Gentiles.</hi> 4.

It is one of the characters of them that are without God in the world, to be enemies to, and ſlanderers of thoſe, who will not run with them to the ſame exceſs of riot: for, it is here a deſcription of the Heathens, that they ſpeak againſt thoſe who are of an honeſt converſation, <hi>as evil doers.</hi> 6. The beſt way for Chriſtians to ſtop the mouthes of their ſlanderers, is, by an honeſt converſation: without which, any other means they can uſe, will readily prove ineffectual for maintaining their reputation: for, here the Apoſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth to Chriſtians the ſtudy of a holy walking, as a mean to put their very enemies upon an exerciſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſlandering of the Godly, <hi>having your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation honeſt among the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God.</hi> 7. Although the Word, accompanied with the powerfull bleſſing of God, be the principal mean of ſinners converſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17, 15. Yet the Lord may make uſe of the very carriage and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible acting of his People, (ſuch as, their equity in their dealings, even with their enemies; their patient bearing of injuries from them, and continuing to expreſſe love and reſpect to them notwithſtanding thereof) to allure wicked men to fall in love with his way, and to give him glory that ever ſent them ſuch a mean, and bleſſed it to them, for their reclaiming from the way of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for, here, an <hi>honeſt converſation</hi> is preſſed, as a mean of gaining the enemies of Chriſt and his People, to <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in the day of viſitation.</hi> 8.

                  <p>In this ſecond part of the Chapter, the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to thoſe particular duties, whereby Chriſtians do ſhew forth the praiſes of God, and commend Religion in their ſeveral relations: And his firſt exhortation, in order to theſe ends, is, That they ſhould carry themſelves with reſpect and ſubmiſſion, to any form of lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, eſtabliſhed in the ſeveral Countries where they were ſcattered, whether the ſame were exerciſed by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105751:51"/>
the ſupream Magiſtrate or by the inferiour: which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral forms of Civil Government, he calleth a Humane Ordinance; mainly, becauſe the Lord hath not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his Word, what particular kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every place in the World ſhould have, whether Monarchy, or ſome other form; but hath left the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thereof to humane prudence, walking by the general rules of his Word: And this exhortation the Apoſtle inferreth upon the former, wherewith the firſt part of the Chapter is cloſed, as a ſpecial mean of gaining wicked men to glorifie God; and preſſeth the ſame by two reaſons: The firſt, is taken from the reſpect, which Chriſtians owe to the Command of God, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Magiſtracy: The ſecond, is taken from the good ends for which Magiſtracy is ordained, To wit, 1. for the puniſhing and ſuppreſſing of wickedneſs; And, 2. for the promoving and encouraging of piety and vertue. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Lord is graciouſly pleaſed to call for reſpect, at the hands of his People, toward thoſe who carry no reſpect to him, that thereby he may either gain ſuch to his obedience, or heap coals of fire upon their heads: for, unto Heathen Magiſtrates he is here calling for ſubmiſſion and obedience at the hands of his People, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man.</hi> 2. Although Civil Magiſtracy be a Divine Ordinance, in regard it is of Gods appointment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. Yet it is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a humane Ordinance,</hi> in regard it is mainly exerciſed about humane affairs, and for the good of humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as ſuch, in regard the particular forms thereof are left to be determined by men, as was touched in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and in ſome caſes, may be altered by them. In all which reſpects, it differeth from that ſpiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Houſe; this being wholly about ſpiritual affairs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. the particular form thereof determined by Jeſus Chriſt in his Word, and never to be altered in any place of the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. for, Civil Government, for the fore-mentioned reſpects, as alſo to difference it from the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105751:52"/>
Eccleſiaſtick, is here called an <hi>Ordinance of man.</hi> 3. Not only private Chriſtians, but alſo the publick Miniſters of Chriſt, and all ranks of profeſſors of his Name, are bound to give ſubmiſſion and obedience in things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, unto lawfull Magiſtrates, though they prove ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto Religion, under whoſe Dominion Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath caſt their lot: which ſubmiſſion, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a reverend eſteem of the perſons of Magiſtrates, becauſe of their Office, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.2. in the maintaining of their Authority and reſpect before others, eſpecially their Subjects, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.27. in giving of our worldly ſubſtance for that end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. in our earneſtneſs with God in prayer for his bleſſing upon their Government, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. and in ſuffering patiently, and with due reſpect to their Perſons and Office what they do unjuſtly inflict for diſobedience to their unlawful commands, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.5. for, this exhortation is given both to the Officers and Members of the Church, ſcattered through thoſe Nations who had only Heathen Kings and Governours, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man.</hi> 4. This dutiful and ſubmiſſive carriage of Chriſtians, toward wicked Magiſtrates, is a ſpecial mean of commending Religion to the profane, and gaining of them to glorifie God, who uſe moſt unjuſtly to repreſent Chriſt's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as enemies to Civil Magiſtrates, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.5. for, this exhortation may be conceived to be preſſed as a ſpecial mean of attaining to that honeſt converſation among the Gentiles, who ſpoke againſt Chriſtians as evil doers, eſpecially in the matter of their loyalty, whereunto the Apoſtle did exhort in the former Verſe; <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man.</hi> 5. It is agreeable to the mind of God that there be plurality of Magiſtrates ſet over every Country or Incorporation of people, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any one, or a few, by reaſon of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of their wit and ſtrength, to adminiſter Juſtice aright to many, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.18, 21. which ought to be brought near to poor people, to prevent their toil and expences ſo far as may be, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.16. And likewiſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105751:52"/>
that there be ſome order among theſe Magiſtrates; ſome of them in greater eminency and power than others: for, ſo the Apoſtle ſupponeth here, while he mentioneth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Magiſtrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Although the ſupream Magiſtrate, may be a prime inſtrument in appointing and protecting inferiour Magiſtrates in the exerciſe of their Office, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.5. in which reſpect the inferiour may be ſaid to <hi>be ſent by him,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Supream;</hi> Yet are the Lord's People no leſſe ſtraitly bound to obey and ſubmit to the inferiour, acting in his ſtation, than to the Supream acting in his, the one being eſſentially Judges, and in God's place, to the people, as well as the other, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, for, the Apoſtle doth preſſe equally, and upon the ſame grounds, ſubmiſſion to both, <hi>whether it be to the King as ſupream, or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him.</hi> 7. This ſubmiſſion and obedience, which Chriſtians owe to lawfull Magiſtrates, ought to ſlow from their reſpect to God's Command enjoyning the ſame; and from love to Him, who hath eſtabliſhed that order among men, and would have his People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending Religion to heathen or profane Magiſtrates by their reſpect to his Ordinance in the perſons of ſuch; ſo that whoſoever have not a hearty reſpect to God and his Commands, and love to Him and his Honour, they want the principle of true loyalty to Magiſtrates, whoſe great care therefore ſhould be, to advance true piety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God, and his Commands in the hearts of their Subjects, as they love to find true loyalty in them to themſelves: for, this is here made the principle or motive of Chriſtians ſubjection to Magiſtracy, <hi>Submit, &amp;c. for the Lords ſake.</hi> 8.

It is the Duty of Magiſtrates, to put moſt honour upon, and give moſt encouragement and reſpect to, thoſe, that live moſt ſubject to the will of Chriſt, thoſe being the beſt friends of Magiſtrates; and the diſgracing or wronging of them, being, in a ſpecial way, reſented by Chriſt, the Supream Magiſtrate: for, this is another end of their Office, and branch of their Duty, that they are <hi>for the praiſe of them that do well.</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105751:53"/>
                     <hi>for ſo is the will of God.</hi> 2. Diſaffection to Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Magiſtracy, is an old ſlander which hath been ordinarily given in againſt the Godly by wicked men, who hate to the death thoſe, who, by their holy walking do reprove and ſhame their profanity; and therefore labour to engage thoſe in power againſt them, as their enemies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.10. for, as it was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily charged upon the Servants and People of God of old, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.13. <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.12, 13. So the Apoſtle, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a way to theſe Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews</hi> how to ſilence ſuch ſlanders, importeth, that it was, in his time, the ordinary tryal of the Godly to whom he writeth, <hi>That with well doing ye may put to ſilence, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Although it be fitting ſometimes for the Lord's People, to uſe verbal apologies for their own clearing, and other lawful means of defence againſt falſe aſperſions, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 25.8. Yet a holy and chriſtian carriage, is the moſt powerful mean (though it be more ſeldom made uſe of than any) to confute the calumnies of wicked men; and to bind up their mouthes (were they never ſo enraged) from ſpeaking againſt the Godly? for, the Apoſtle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recommended this mean for this end before, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. preſcribeth it here again, importing the fitneſſe of it for the end for which he preſſeth it, and likewiſe ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs in people to make uſe of it; <hi>That with well doing ye may put to ſilence</hi> (in which word, there is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor taken from the putting of a muſle upon the mouth of ſome wild beaſt, or mad-dog, ſuch as the malicious ſlanderers of God's People are) <hi>the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> 4. The ground of wicked mens malice, which vents it ſelf againſt the Godly in ſlanders, and in miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of them, eſpecially to men in power, is, that they are groſly ignorant, to wit, of the terror of that God who reſents the leaſt wrong done to his Servants, as done to himſelf, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. and of the due ſubordination of men in Authority to Him, by reaſon whereof, His People may diſobey their ſinful commands, without any wrong to their Office, or diſreſpect to their Perſons, <hi>Act.</hi>

4.19. for, here the Apoſtle leads the Lord's People, to take the malicious calumnies of wicked men, for the language of their ignorance, that ſo they might rather pity and pray for them, than ſtudy to requite them, as their Lord did upon the ſame conſideration, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. while he thus directs, <hi>with well doing put to ſilence the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of fooliſh men.</hi> 5. They who imploy their wit to make the Lord's People odious, and bring them under hazard from thoſe that are in power over them, although they may have as much uſe of it as may get them the car and favour of them that are in power, and may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail by their calumnies to bring trouble upon the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Yet, are they really and in Gods eſteem, mad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as the word here ſignifieth, ſeing by their ſo doing they run the hazard of the wrath of Him, who is a jealous and a terrible God againſt his Peoples ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14, 17. for, the Apoſtle's ſcope and ſtrain here, doth import, that malicious ſlanders of the Godly, given-in to thoſe in Authority, had ſuch acceptance and weight with them, as to occaſion the riſe of perſecution from them againſt the Godly: and yet thoſe who gave in theſe ſlanders, are here repreſented by the Spirit of God as <hi>ignorant and fooliſh men.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle, in anſwer to an objection, which hath been in the hearts of ſome profeſſors, againſt that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which he had preſt upon them, to Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to wit, that their chriſtian liberty did exempt them from it; eſpecially, thoſe Magiſtrates being wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and pagans, bringeth in a fourth argument to preſſe the ſame: The ſum whereof is, That however Believers be brought by Jeſus Chriſt to a ſtate of true and ſpiritual freedom; Yet the Lord doth not allow them to make their chriſtian liberty a pretence or vail to cover any wickedneſſe; and conſequently, not that wickedeſſe of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105751:54"/>
deſpiſing and rejecting his Ordinance of Magiſtracy; but on the contrary, doth enjoyn them all to uſe their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, purchaſed by Chriſt, wholly, as an engagement and motive to his ſervice. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, are by him advanced to a ſtate of true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedom, which doth not conſiſt in a liberty to ſin againſt God, which is Satans ſlavery, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. nor in freedom from the ſweet yoke of his ſervice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in attending his Ordinances, to which he hath tied us till his ſecond coming, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. or the duties we owe to others of his People, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. But it doth conſiſt in our freedom from the Law as a Covenant of works, by which we are not to ſeek Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or Salvation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. we are free from the guilt of ſin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14 from the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. and the curſe due thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2. and from the yoke of Moſaical Ceremonies, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. and, eſpecially, in this we are free, that we are honoured and enabled to do God acceptable ſervice, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.45. In all which reſpects, Believers are preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed truly, free according to the Apoſtle's conceſſion here, <hi>As free.</hi> 2. Even the Redeemed Ones by Chriſt have as much corruption remaining unmortified in their hearts after Regeneration as makes them in hazard, not only to commit wickedneſſe, and excuſe the ſame; but to make the priviledges they have through Chriſt, and particularly their chriſtian liberty, a cloak to hide it, as if ſin were no ſin in them, or as if Chriſt had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them liberty to ſin: for, ſo much is imported in the Apoſtle's diſſwading Chriſtians here not only from refuſing ſubjection to Magiſtrates, but from defending the ſame, and uſing their liberty as a cloak of that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; <hi>As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſſe.</hi> 3. When Chriſtians ſhake off any duty preſt in the Moral Law, under a pretence that their chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty gives them warrant ſo to do, they are then come to ſuch a height of wickedneſſe, as hath much of malice in it; eſpecially, againſt any that would oppoſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105751:55"/>
them in that courſe, and ſuch as will ſpread to more and more wickedneſſe: for, the Apoſtle ſets forth here, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, defending their exemption from obedience to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, with the pretext of their chriſtian liberty, by ſuch a word as doth comprehend in the ſignification of it, all wickedneſſe; and points eſpecially, at that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin of malice, or envie; <hi>Not uſing your liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſſe.</hi> 4. Theſe iniquities which are unjuſtly charged upon all the Godly by wicked men, may be juſtly charged by the Godly themſelves upon their own hearts, as inclinable to thoſe iniquities, which do break forth in ſome: for, the Apoſtle, having in the former Verſe, called them ignorant and fooliſh men, who did ſlander all Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, as enemies to Magiſtracy, doth here warn all to beware to make their chriſtian liberty a cloak of it, while he ſaith, <hi>Not uſing your liberty as a cloak of maliciouſneſſe.</hi> 5. The right uſe which Believers ought to make of that liberty, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, is to be thereby the more ſtrictly engaged to his ſervice; our ſerving of Him being a great part of true chriſtian liberty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.45. and one great end of God's giving a Redeemer for us, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. for, here the Apoſtle diſcovers wherein the right uſe of chriſtian liberty did conſiſt, to wit, that Chriſtians who are truly free, ſhould carry themſelves <hi>as the ſervants of God.</hi>

                  <p>The fifth argument, whereby the Apoſtle preſſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Chriſtians due ſubjection to Civil Magiſtrates, is taken from the neceſſary connexion that is betwixt this and other unqueſtionable duties: of which, the Apoſtle giveth three inſtances; every one whereof, doth in ſome ſort infer the equity of this duty, which was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned by ſome of them: The firſt, is, That ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is due to all men, and therefore much more to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105751:55"/>
The ſecond is, That chriſtian ſociety ſhould be very dear to all the Lord's People; and conſequently they ought to reſpect Magiſtrates under whoſe power and protection they do enjoy the ſame. The third is, That they ſhould ſtand in aw to offend God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould give that honour to Magiſtrates, which he had ſo ſtraitly enjoyned by the Apoſtle before, and here preſſeth again in the cloſe of this Verſe. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. While the Miniſters of Chriſt are earneſtly preſſing ſome one ſpecial duty upon the Lord's People, they ought alſo joyntly to preſs ſuch other duties as are to be joyned therewith in their practice, and may be helpfull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the performance of that, leſt by inſiſting much in the preſſing of one duty, without mentioning of others, which ought to be carried along therewith, the Lord's People may receive ſuch impreſſion of the neceſſity of that one, as may make them forgetful of others, not only equally neceſſary with that one, but alſo ſubſervient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the performance of it: for, while the Apoſtle is earneſtly preſſing ſubjection to Magiſtrates by many reaſons, he intermixeth a bundle of other duties, which are neceſſary to be joyned in practice with that; and being made conſcience of, will fit them for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, <hi>Honour all men. Love the Brotherhood. Fear God.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Honour the King.</hi> 2. It is a prevailing way of dealing with the Lord's People (which Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould ſtudy) to bear in upon them duties more queſtionable, againſt which they may have ſome preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, as neceſſary concommitants or effects of other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they do leſſe queſtion, and will more eaſily ſubject themſelves unto, that from the acknowledged equity of the one, they may be brought to yeeld to the other, which hath neceſſary connexion therewith: even as it is a moſt convincing way of reaſoning upon any ſubject, to make uſe of premiſes eaſily aſſented to, for gaining aſſent to ſome queſtionable concluſion, which is the Apoſtle's way here; for while he preſſeth the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſubjection to Civil Magiſtrates, from which ſome
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105751:56"/>
Profeſſors of Chriſtianity did apprehend themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted by their chriſtian liberty, he preſſeth upon them ſuch other unqueſtionable duties as did infer that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by the force of good conſequence; if they found themſelves bound to honour all men, to love the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to fear God, then they could not but find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound alſo <hi>to honour the King.</hi> 3. Although there be ſome ſo groſly and avowedly wicked, that they ought to be contemned and eſteemed vile by the Lord's People in compariſon of others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. Yet, there is no man, to whom the Children of the Lord do not owe ſome reſpect; conſidering that all men do partake of ſome excellency from God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and carry ſome reſemblance of his Image, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3 9. and that the beſt may know more to be loathed in themſelves, than they can do in the worſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.3. and that the worſt, for ought we know, may be within the compaſſe of God's election, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.16. for which cauſes, we ought to give them ſome ſigns of our reſpect, that ſo we may keep our ſelves in the better capacity of doing good to their ſouls; <hi>Honour all men.</hi> 4. It is not only the duty of every Chriſtian to give a ſpecial meaſure of love and reſpect to the perſons of other Chriſtians, beyond what they give to any other men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. and to evidence the ſame by their ſympathy with, and ſupply of, one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other under their neceſſities, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. But alſo to love the ſociety one of another, both in the exerciſe of publick Ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which Chriſt hath promiſed his ſpecial preſence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. and in the more private duties of mutual edification, which are very pleaſant to the Lord, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. and profitable to themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, 13. for, the Apoſtle having exhorted to <hi>honour all men,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth this, as a further degree of reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only to the Saints themſelves, But as the word ſignifies, to their ſociety, <hi>Love the Brotherhood.</hi> 5. It ſhould be the great care of the Children of God, to carry along in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of every duty, the fear of God in their hearts: which is a frame of ſpirit that he worketh in all that are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105751:56"/>
in Covenant with him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. whereby they hate every known ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.13. and, in obedience to him, aim at every commanded duty, eſpecially, thoſe of their particular relations, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.7. and is entertained by the believing conſideration of the terror of the Lord, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.119, 120. his excellency, <hi>Job</hi> 13.11. his goodneſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. and his proneneſſe to pardon ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. All which is comprehended under this duty, which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth all the reſt, here preſſed; <hi>Fear God.</hi> 6. There is a ſpecial meaſure of honour and reſpect due by the Lords People unto thoſe whom God hath ſet in Lawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, beyond what is due to any others on earth, by reaſon of their place, wherein they reſemble the Majeſty of God to his People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, having exhorted in the beginning of this Verſe, to honour all men, as if that honour which is due to all, were not ſufficient for Magiſtrates, he cloſeth the Verſe with this, <hi>Honour the King.</hi> 7. The Lord's People, are ſo to honour Magiſtrates, as that they forget not the fear of the Lord, and the duties comprehended under it, in the firſt place: without which no duty can be faithfully diſcharged to any man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.2. for, this is not only the order of the words here, but of the purpoſe it ſelf; <hi>Fear God. Honour the King.</hi> 8. Theſe duties, againſt which the hearts of the Godly have ſome prejudice, and the neglect whereof, proveth moſt offenſive to the profane, had need to be frequently and earneſtly preſt upon the Lord's People: for this duty was unpleaſant to many Profeſſors, and the profane apprehending it to be ſo to all, were incenſed againſt Chriſtians: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Apoſtle, having preſſed it before, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. reneweth his exhortation to it here again, <hi>Honour the King.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond exhortation to the ſtudy of holineſſe, for ſhewing forth the praiſes of God, is directed to Chriſtian Servants, in which rank the greateſt number of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then were, who ſeem to have been in hazard, under pretence of their chriſtian liberty, not only to ſhake off ſubjection to Magiſtrates, (as was ſhewen before) but to their particular Maſters (the moſt part whereof were alſo at that time Heathens) unto whom, the Apoſtle preſſeth Chriſtian Servants to give ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, with all fear, to wit, of offending God, or their Maſters; and that not only to the better and more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſort of them, but even to the more auſtere and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the Children of the Lord in the meaneſt and hardeſt condition wherein his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth caſt them, may be inſtrumentall in bringing ſome glory to Him; So, He is eſpecially glorified by them in their conſcionable diſcharge of the particular duties of that relation wherein they are fixed: for, the Apoſtle (having ſhewen the end of all Believers privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, to be, that they might ſhew forth the praiſes of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.) holdeth forth this to perſecuted Chriſtian Servants, as one principal way of ſhewing forth His praiſes; <hi>Servants be ſubject to your Maſters.</hi> 2. One wrong principle, being admitted in the minds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, concerning the matters of God, may be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and riſe of manifold diſorders in their practice: for, it is clear from the former purpoſe, that the miſtake of Chriſtians, concerning the nature of their chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, did make them apprehend themſelves exempted from ſubjection to Magiſtracy; and by this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediatly ſubjoyned, compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20, 21, 22. it doth appear that the ſame miſtake hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, to make Servants apprehend exemption from ſubjection to their Heathen Maſters, which makes the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105751:57"/>
Apoſtle find it neceſſary to preſſe them to this duty, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be ſubject to your Masters.</hi> 3. Although there be ſome of the great ones of the earth, given by the Father to Chriſt the Mediator, who will therefore receive Him, and ſubject themſelves to Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.10. Yet the moſt part of. His Subjects and Servants are of the pooreſt and meaneſt in the world, whom He chooſes, to commend the freedom of His grace, and the condeſcendency of His love, which often lights upon the Servant, and paſſeth by the Maſter: for, it would ſeem, there hath not been many Magiſtrates or Maſters in thoſe Nations where theſe believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle writes, were ſcattered, who have been fit to be ſpoken to, which makes the Apoſtle omit them, and ſpeak to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the former words, and to their Servants here, <hi>Servants be ſubject to your Maſters.</hi> 4. Chriſtian liberty, doth not exempt Chriſtian Servants from ſubjection to their Maſters, though they were Heathens, but doth conſiſt with obeying all their lawful commands hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as ſervice to God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22, 23. in giving due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their perſons, as being placed above them, as the word here ſignifieth: for, this is here preſt upon the choſen Generation, and ſuch as were truly free by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; <hi>Servants be ſubject to your Maſters,</hi> 5. Not only the immediate acts of God's Worſhip and Service, ſhould be gone about with much fear and reverence to Him in the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. but even theſe outward duties, which we owe to men, ſhould be ſeaſoned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that ſo Chriſtians, even while they are employed in moſt common duties, may be in the fear of the Lord all the day long, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.17. for, this is the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſubjection, which Chriſtian Servants owe to their Maſters, <hi>Be ſubject with all fear.</hi> 6. It may be the lot of the Lords deareſt People, not only to be in the rank of Servants, which is a part of their likeneſs to their Lord for His outward ſtate in the fleſh, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.7. but likewiſe to be, by divine providence, put to ſerve Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and the worſt of Heathens, that ſo the Lord may
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105751:58"/>
make them inſtrumental to do good to ſome of theſe, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.2, 3. or convince them that God is with their Servants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.44. for, here the Apoſtle ſuppones ſome of the choſen Generation, and the peculiar People, to be Servants to Heathens, and to froward and perverſe Heathens. 7. Although all that are without the ſaving knowledge of God in Chriſt, be in a like damnable and curſed eſtate, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. Yet there may be amongſt them much difference of diſpoſition, ſome of them being of a more bountiful and liberal temper, as the word, here rendered <hi>good,</hi> may ſignifie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15. and leſſe rigid in exacting all that in ſtrict juſtice they might, as the word, tranſlated <hi>gentle,</hi> doth import; others of them more perverſe and harder to have dealing with, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſignification of this word <hi>froward:</hi> which difference, doth mainly flow from the Lord's various diſpenſation of the gifts of nature, and his common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences for improving the ſame, according to His So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign pleaſure: for, here among wicked and heathen Maſters, there are ſome good and equitable, or moderate, to wit, in compariſon of ſome others of them, and there are others who are more perverſe or <hi>froward.</hi> 8. The wickedneſſe of thoſe, to whom in God's providence Chriſtians are tied by any relation, doth not exempt them from making conſcience of the duties of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion toward thoſe to whom they are tied; the ground of our duty, not being the qualification of the perſon to whom we owe it, but the Command of God obliging us to it: <hi>Servants be ſubject to your Maſters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward.</hi>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105751:58"/>
bringeth many arguments, to preſſe upon Chriſtian Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, dutifulneſs to their Pagan-Maſters, and patient ſuffering of injuries from them in following their duty to Chriſt. The firſt, is, That if they did out of reſpect to Chriſt's command and glory, hold on in their duty, notwithſtanding of hardeſt ſufferings, He ſhould graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reward their ſo doing, as acceptable ſervice to Him, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. The ſecond is, That it would be a great diſgrace for Chriſtians to deſerve by their miſcarriage hard uſage from Heathens; but, if they were faithful in their duty, and patient under ſufferings for it, they might be ſure of God's approbation, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although neither our doing, nor our ſuffering, can merit any thing at God's hand, it being wholly His grace (as the firſt expreſſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. may be rendered from the Original) that enables us for both, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. Yet when His grace hath in ſome meaſure enabled us for both, He is pleaſed to eſteem thereof as if it were worthy of thanks from Him; and graciouſly to reward it with a further increaſe of grace, and ability to do and ſuffer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.19. with begun peace and conſolation in the heart under ſufferings for duty to Him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. as earneſt of the full reward which His grace is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow at laſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4, 5. which ought to be a ſufficient encouragement to the Godly in their duty againſt all their ſufferings from men, for which end, it is held forth here: for, <hi>This is thank-worthy,</hi> or (as the Original may be rendered) <hi>this is grace.</hi> 2. God doth not ſo much reſpect the ſufferings of Profeſſors, even for Truth and Duty (ſeing Hypocrites may attain thereunto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.) as He looks unto the principle and manner of their ſufferings, whether they ſuffer becauſe of their former engagements by profeſſion, or otherwiſe; and becauſe they deſire to carry a name and eſteem of religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the end with them: or, whether they ſuffer out of conſcience toward God, that is, in obedience to Him, who commands them to chooſe affliction rather than ſin, and from a deſire to pleaſe and honour Him, by bearing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105751:59"/>
Teſtimony to His Truth, by ſuffering: for, this ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and this only, is reckoned <hi>thank-worthy, if a man for conſcience toward God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> endure grief, ſuffering wrongfully.</hi> 3. Although the Lord ſometimes keeps heavineſſe and grief off the ſpirits of his People under ſuch ſufferings, as are very heavie and grievous in themſelves, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. Yet, at other times, He ſees it ſitting, not only to exerciſe them with hard and unjuſt ſufferings from men, but likewiſe with many ſad weights upon their ſpirits under theſe ſufferings, ariſing partly from the ſight of God's diſhonour by their enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.3. and partly from the fear of their own miſcarriage under their trials, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. together with their miſ-belief of the Promiſe of their through-bearing and out-gate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. both which exerciſes together, are ſometimes neceſſary for the Godly, that they may be compleatly denied to their own ſtrength and courage, and may be taught to depend on God for their through-bearing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both exerciſes ought to be patiently ſubmitted unto by them, in ſo far as they are for their trial and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, even as they would expect a reward from God: <hi>for, this is thank-worthy, if a man for conſcience toward God, endure grief, ſuffering wrongfully.</hi> 4. Although it be the mark of Hypocrites to do all duties of Religion for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their own credit and glory before men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.5. Yet, the Lord allows His own People to have ſo much reſpect to their own credit, eſpecially before the profane, as may provoke them to a tender and holy walking, and to eſchew every thing that may diſgrace them, and their holy Profeſſion: for, this is here made an argument to duty, and patient ſuffering of wrongs, that if they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected duty, and ſo were put to ſuffer for their miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, That would be no glory, but rather a diſgrace to them, and their Profeſſion; <hi>for, what glory is it, if when ye be buffetted for your faults, ye ſhall take it patiently?</hi> 5. As it hath pleaſed the Lord for the good of humane ſociety, to leave in the minds, even of Heathens, ſome knowledge of what is contrary to His will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105751:59"/>
15. and ſome inclination to puniſh the ſame, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.4. So it is a very great diſgrace to Chriſtian Religion, when Heathens, or ſuch as are like Heathens, void of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of God in Chriſt, may find Chriſtians in thoſe ſins, which their light leads them to puniſh, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when Chriſtians make their liberty by Chriſt, a pretence and cloak to cover thoſe ſins: for, it is here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Apoſtle, that Heathen Maſters did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know ſome what of their Servants duty, but alſo would juſtly puniſh them for neglect of it; and that, if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Servants did by their miſcarriage deſerve ſufferings from ſuch Maſters, (as they were in hazard to do by abuſing their chriſtian liberty) this would prove a great diſgrace to them, and to the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity: <hi>for, what glory is it, if when ye be buffetted for your faults, ye ſhall take it patiently?</hi> 6. Although patience, under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſtroaks from men, be in it ſelf commendable, and will prove perſons to be accepted with God, when they accept the puniſhment of their iniquity, and flie to Chriſt for mercy, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.41. Yet the patience of a Profeſſor of Religion, under thoſe ſtroaks, which his own miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage hath juſtly procured from wicked men, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his diſgrace, nor the diſgrace of his profeſſion, nor be any glory to him, in compariſon of what patience under ſufferings for well-doing would be: for, this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>What glory is it, if when ye be buffetted for your faults, ye take it patiently?</hi> imports, that their ſufferings for their faults, though never ſo patiently, would be no glory to them, to wit, in compariſon of what it would be to ſuffer patiently for well-doing. 7. As none may expect that well-doing will exempt them from trouble and ſuffering, but rather that it will occaſion and increaſe the ſame; So, the Lord's favour toward ſufferers, and His acceptation of them, and of their ſufferings as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Him, ſhould be thought a ſufficient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to patience under that lot; and ſhould be often conſidered as a recompence of all the ſhame and pain of the croſſe: for, with this encouragement, which the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105751:60"/>
Apoſtle held forth, for the ſubſtance of it, in the begining of the former Verſe he cloſes this Verſe: <hi>If when ye do well and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently: this is acceptable with God.</hi>

                  <p>Here are ſome further arguments, to preſſe upon Chriſtians patient ſuffering for the Truth of Chriſt, and Duty to Him. The third, in number is, That they were by the Goſpel called to follow Chriſt with a croſſe upon their back. The fourth is, That Chriſt hath in their room born all the wrath that's due to them for their ſins. And the fifth, is, That he hath caſt a ſweet copy and patern of a right way of ſuffering for all His own to imitate: and therefore they ſhould hold on in their duty, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſufferings. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As Chriſt's Followers are called by the Goſpel, to enjoy a ſweet fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Him here, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. and to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of glory with Him hereafter, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.14. So, are they alſo called to endure a ſuffering lot in the world for following their duty to Him: for, to thoſe who were ſuffering wrongfully for well-doing, the Apoſtle thus ſpeaketh, <hi>Even hereunto were ye called.</hi> 2. Chriſt doth not hide this hard lot of ſuffering from His Followers, till they meet with it; but when firſt He invites them to engage with Him, He gives them fore-warning of the worſt that may befall them in His ſervice, that ſo they may not be offended at it when it comes, <hi>Job.</hi> 16.1. that they may give proof of their eſteem of Him, by conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take up a croſſe for Him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37, 38. and by their former conſent to follow Him upon theſe tearms, may be the more ſtrongly engaged to adventure upon ſuffering for Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.18. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. for, the Apoſtle brings this, as an argument to patient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſuffering, <hi>that even hereunto were they called.</hi> 3. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105751:60"/>
Chriſt hath ſuffered in the room and place of the Elect, ſo that none who are one with Him have any part of vindictive wrath to undergo, whatever fatherly diſpleaſure they may be exerciſed with to humble them in the ſenſe of ſin, and wrath due to them, that ſo they may flee to Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30. <hi>becauſe Chriſt alſo hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us.</hi> 4. Chriſt's ſuffering thus for Believers, doth ſtrongly oblige and encourage them to ſuffer for Him, when they muſt either ſuffer, or ſin againſt Him, ſeing His ſufferings for them, hath freed them from wrath, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and made everlaſting bleſſedneſſe ſure for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for, this is the Apoſtle's fourth argument, to ſuffer for well-doing, <hi>becauſe Chriſt alſo hath ſuffered for us.</hi> 5. Although it be high preſumption in any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to aim at imitation of Chriſt in theſe acts of His, which He did for ſatisfying the Father's juſtice for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for proving of His Deity, and the like, it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impoſſible to imitate Him in theſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24. Yet Chriſtians are bound to imitate Chriſt in theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His, which being in themſelves moral, are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely propounded in Scripture for Chriſtians to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, ſuch as meekneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. humility, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.12, 13. ſelf-denial, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.2, 3. and here, patient and conſtant ſuffering for well-doing: <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow His ſteps.</hi> 6. Although the beſt will ſtill be far ſhort of conformity to their patern Chriſt Jeſus, even in theſe things wherein they are to imitate Him, and in which ſome meaſure of conformity may be attained; Yet ought we not to give over, but ſtill aim at the next time to come nearer our copy, which is perfect in it ſelf, and able to change thoſe who by Faith look on it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. for, there is a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor in the word here, taken from an exact copy which is caſt to Children, whereunto they are ſtill to ſtudy more conformity, though after many eſſayes they be very unlike it; <hi>leaving us an example that we ſhould follow.</hi> 7. Jeſus Chriſt doth not call His Followers to ſtep any hand ſtep in His ſervice, but ſuch as He hath trod before

them himſelf, whoſe paths drop fatneſſe to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.11. and who by His Spirit doth yet go along with them through the hardeſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.8. for his ſteps, here ſpoken of, are both the ſeveral kinds of His ſufferings from wicked men, which He went through, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the right way of ſuffering wherein we are to imitate Him, <hi>who hath left us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle inſiſts in commending Chriſt, as the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers copy, from three particulars: which may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſo many further arguments to patient ſuffering for well-doing. The ſixth, in order, taken from Chriſt's innocency, is, That ſeing He who did not in the leaſt offend either God or man, was handled as a ſinner, His ſinful Followers ſhould therefore take well with ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. The ſeventh, taken from His patience, is, That ſince the Son of God, when foul crimes were laid to His charge, did not at all requite His ſlanderers, nor give the leaſt ill word for the worſt uſage; therefore patience under injuries, without ſtudying revenge, becomes His Followers. The eighth, taken from His Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, is, That ſeing Chriſt did reſign Himſelf to His righteous Father, to deal with Him, and His perſecutors as He ſaw fitting, they that deſire to be like Him, ſhould take the ſame courſe. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt Jeſus our Mediator, was altogether free of the leaſt tranſgreſſion of, or defect in, conformity to the Law of God, though the ſtrongeſt of Satan's fiery darts were ſhot at Him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 16.22, 23. Yet, His Bow abode in its ſtrength, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.24 there being nothing in Him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend a temptation, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.30. He being by His mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105751:61"/>
conception, exempted from the contagion of Original ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. whence actual tranſgreſſions flow, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. and it behoved Him to be ſo, that He might be compleatly lovely to God, as being the truth of all thoſe ſpotleſs Lambs that were offered under the Law, as types of Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. and that He might be a perfect pattern of holineſſe to His Followers, <hi>who did no ſin.</hi> 2. There is nothing but truth and ſincerity in all the words of Chriſt, He never expreſt more willingneſſe to receive and do good unto ſinners, than He doth mind really to make out to all that come to Him; nor hath He expreſt more wrath againſt ſlighters of Him, than they ſhall find to be true: for, this is another branch of the commendation of Chriſt from His innocency, <hi>Neither was guile found in His mouth.</hi> 3 How innocent ſoever the Children of the Lord may be of thoſe crimes, which are unjuſtly charged upon them by perſecutors, as the cauſe of their ſufferings; Yet, the ſenſe of their ſinfulneſs in other things, ought to make them ſubmiſſive to, and patient under hardeſt ſufferings from men, conſidering that they ſuffer for leſſe than they deſerve, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.13. and that it becomes them to bear indignation becauſe they have ſinned, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.9. for, the Apoſtle propoſeth the innocency of Chriſt, who was a patient ſufferer, as an argument from the more to the leſſe, to move ſinfull things not to take ill with ſufferings, ſince Chriſt was a patient ſufferer, <hi>who did no ſin, &amp;c.</hi> 4. As all that would glorifie the Lord by their ſufferings, and have comfort under them, muſt ſtudy to imitate Jeſus Chriſt in His innocency and ſincerity; So, they that have attained to the greateſt meaſure of conformity to Him in theſe, may not therefore expect exemption from ſad ſufferings, but rather, the liker to Him in theſe they are, to look for the worſe uſage from wicked men: for, as Chriſt's inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and ſincerity are here held forth as ſteps of His which they that would honour Him by their ſufferings, and have comfort under them, muſt follow; So, He is here held forth as expoſed to extream grievous ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105751:62"/>
notwithſtanding He had theſe in their perfection, <hi>He did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth: yet He was reviled,</hi> and put to hardeſt ſufferings. 5. It was the lot of our Lord Jeſus, when He was in our place, in the eſtate of His humiliation, not only to ſuffer hard things in His Perſon, but likewiſe in His Name; to have that rent and torn with reproaches, and to have foul crimes (as the word here, rendred <hi>to reviſe,</hi> ſignifies) unjuſtly laid to His charge, ſuch as compliance with Satan, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.20. blaſphemy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.33. ſedition, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.2. and the like: and that becauſe, though He never did any thing worthy of blame, He ſtood in the room of many ſinners really guilty of all theſe crimes, which were only upon Him by imputation, ſo as He bear the curſe of God, and the ſhame of the world, that was due to theſe ſins: for, this lot is here ſuppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed to have been Chriſt's, that He not only ſuffered, but was <hi>reviled.</hi> 6. While our Lord Jeſus was under this lot, He did not give a meeting of any kind to his enemies, but was ſo far from charging them with foul crimes unjuſtly, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling, that when they had done ſo to Him, calling Him a Devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.48. He did not at that time ſo much as repeat the like challenge, which He had before juſtly laid to their charge, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. and though He did ſometimes threaten fearful judgments upon deſpiſers of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God through Him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his receiving of greateſt perſonal wrongs, He did not ſo much as renew any of theſe threatnings, but on the contrary prayed for his enemies, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. leſt in the miſapprehenſion of any onlookers, His ſufferings might have been ſtained with imputation of paſſion or revenge, and his followers might have abuſed his practiſe to vent their carnal paſſion againſt their perſecutors; the hazard whereof, is likewiſe imported in the Apoſtle's guarding thus againſt it, <hi>Who when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He ſuffered, He threatned not.</hi> 7. As all Chriſt's Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſhould reſolve to meet with grievous reproaches and ſlanders, joyned with their other ſufferings, as Chriſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105751:62"/>
did, So ought they to follow Chriſt's ſteps, in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting their enemies, or giving ill language for the worſt uſage, but muſt learn to die to their reputation as well as to other things, for His ſake, <hi>who when He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, reviled not again; when He ſuffered, he threatned not.</hi> 8. While Chriſt our Lord was ſuffering in our room. He did with much confidence and willingneſſe deliver Himſelf up to the will of his righteous Father, to endure the utmoſt that was due to ſinners, according to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking in the Covenant of Redemption, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 40.7, 8. knowing that his Father's righteouſneſſe was engaged in the ſame Covenant, to ſuſtain his Manhead under all his ſufferings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to reward Him for them, by giving Him all that He died for, as his ſeed, to ſerve him, and praiſe him for ever, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11. and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all the reſt according to their deſerving, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.5, 6. for, this is here expreſly aſſerted as the ground of the patience and ſubmiſſion of the man Chriſt to the Fathers will, <hi>He committed himſelf to Him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> 9. Although theſe acts of Faith which do neceſſarily preſuppoſe guiltineſſe, or have with them any mixture of miſ-belief or diſcouragement, could not be in Chriſt, who was holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, and ſeparated from ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. Yet His Soul was eminently endued with the grace of Faith, as it is taken for reſting upon the faithfulneſſe of God, and reſignation of ones per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and cauſe to Him under unjuſt ſufferings from men: for, thus is Chriſt here, as a Believer, deſcribed, <hi>He committed Himſelf to Him that judgeth righteouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 10. The oppreſt and ſuffering People of God, who are not able to defend themſelves from wrongs at mens hands, nor to redreſſe the ſame, ought to commit themſelves and their cauſe to God their Father, as to a righteous Judge, not out of malice againſt, or deſire of judgment upon, their perſecutors, but as a mean to prevent their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency of ſpirit, and deſpair under their hard uſage: for, this practiſe of Chriſt's is one of his ſteps, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Chriſtians ought to follow; <hi>He committed himſelf
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105751:63"/>
to Him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> 11. The beſt way for Chriſtians to attain to true chriſtian patience under a croſſe for Chriſt, to keep down their carnal paſſions, while they ſuffer wrongfully from men, and to guard their hearts againſt the ſtudy of revenge toward their perſecutors, is, to reſign themſelves, and their cauſe, in the hands of God the righteous Judge: for, though there was no hazard of ſuch ſinfull motions in Chriſt, yet He took that courſe which He knew would be moſt effectual to prevent them in his Followers, whom He would have to follow his ſteps in this, as a mean to keep them down; <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again &amp;c. but committed himſelf to Him that judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle repeateth, and enlargeth his fourth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (it being the ſweeteſt and ſtrongeſt of all the reſt) to preſſe patient ſuffering for well-doing, to wit, That ſince Chriſt hath born the weight of our ſins, by enduring the wrath due to us for them in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the croſſe, how patiently ſhould his Redeemed Ones, bear light afflictions for his ſake? And withal, he adds ſome further arguments to preſſe the ſame point, taken from the ſweet ends of Chriſt's death, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages Believers have thereby. The ninth in number, is, That the very end of Chriſt's death, being to purchaſe vertue for the ſlaying of ſin in his own, and for quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to the duties of holineſſe, it doth become all his Redeemed Ones to follow their duty, without deſire of revenge upon thoſe who put them to ſuffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. The tenth, is, That ſeing the Redeemed by Chriſt have ſpiritual and eternal health and welfare, by vertue of thoſe wounds which he received from God, and men, for them; therefore they ought not to take in evil part,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105751:63"/>
wounds and ſtripes from men, for following their duty to him. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt's ſuffering in the room of the Redeemed, is a ſubject that they ſhould not ſoon weary to think and ſpeak of, it being to them a ground of much patience and comfort under their ſufferings, to conſider, that God cannot now be avenging himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for their ſins, who are fled to Chriſt, nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſatisfaction to his juſtice at their hands, he having received it already from Chriſt: Therefore, the Apoſtle, having held forth Chriſt's ſufferings, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to conſtancy in duty, notwithſtanding of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution from men, he loveth to come over the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here again, <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The ſufferings of Chriſt were not only exemplary, that we might have a copy how to carry our ſelves right under our ſufferings, but they were expiatory of our ſins, and ſatisfactory for them to the Fathers juſtice: for, after the Apoſtle had ſet forth Chriſt in the former words, as caſting us a copy of the right way of ſuffering, leſt any ſhould think that to be his greateſt deſign in ſuffering, he addeth this, <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body.</hi> 3. Jeſus Chriſt our Mediatour, who was altogether free of any guiltineſs inherent in himſelf (as was cleared from <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.) had all the ſins of the Elect upon him by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and was handled by divine juſtice, as if he had been guilty of them all, as is imported in this expreſſion, <hi>He bare our ſins,</hi> which frequently in Scripture ſignifies, to bear the puniſhment of ſin; See <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.17, 20. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.49. 4. As ſin is to a waking conſcience one of the heavieſt burdens that ever was felt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. So Jeſus Chriſt hath by his ſatisfaction upon the croſſe, lifted up (as the word here ſignifieth) that weight from off the conſcience of thoſe, who feel as much of it as chaſes them to him for eaſe, ſo as it ſhall never preſſe any ſuch down to hell, or to deſpair: for, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of his own ſins, and the ſins of other penitent and believing ſinners, as a weight that none but Chriſt was able to lift, and which he hath lifted up and born, <hi>Who his
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105751:64"/>
own ſelf bare our ſins.</hi> 5. That the ſecond Perſon of the bleſſed Trinity might be fit to bear our ſins, he behoved to be incarnate, and to take on a true body, not borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or aſſumed for a time, but a body of his own, which with his ſoul being perſonally united to his Godhead, he will keep for ever and ever, that his converſing in Heaven with his Creatures that have bodies may be the more ſweet: for, <hi>he bare our ſins in his own body.</hi> 6. Although the principal part of Chriſt's ſufferings for us, was in his ſoul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. Yet, he is ſaid to bear our ſins in his body, not only becauſe that is an ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the whole Perſon, conſiſting of ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but becauſe it is moſt wonderful that ever the Son of God ſhould have aſſumed ſo frothy a being, as a body of fleſh; becauſe his bodily ſufferings did viſibly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his love to ſinners, and the deſert of ſin; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſoul ſuffered only while it was in his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He bare our ſins in his body.</hi> 7. Our Mediatour behoved to be put to a painfull, lingering, and ſhamefull death, becauſe he was in the room of many who deſerve ſuch kind of deaths, even by humane Laws, that he might the better illuſtrate the terror of God againſt ſin, and might take the ſting out of ſuch kind of deaths to any of his own, who ſhould endure the like for his ſake; for theſe cauſes <hi>he bare our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi> to wit, of the croſſe. 8. That which doth moſt heighten our eſteem of Chriſt's love, in giving himſelf to die for us, and moſt ſtrongly oblige us not to ſpare our perſons for him, is the conſideration of the excellency of his Perſon, and of our unworthineſſe for whom he ſuffered; both which the Apoſtle leads Believers unto here, while he doth ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mention him and us, <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree, that we, &amp;c.</hi> 9. Till the merit of Chriſt's death be applied by Faith to the hearts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they are alive to ſin, being active, and delighting in the commiſſion thereof; they are dead to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being no leſſe impotent for any ſpiritual act, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105751:64"/>
holy performance, than dead men are for the actions of the living; as is ſupponed in this, That Chriſt's death was for theſe ends, <hi>that we being dead to ſin, might live to righteouſneſſe.</hi> 10. Chriſt's intention in dying for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which he doth in ſome meaſure gain in all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Ones in this life, and will fully attain in the other, was, That the love of ſin in their hearts, might by the vertue purchaſed with his bloud, be ſo weakened, that they might have no more pleaſure in the commiſſion of it, than dead men have in the delights of the living, and that their hearts might be quickened with ſpiritual life, for holy performances, and they might live eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praiſing their Redeemer for that righteouſneſſe of his beſtowed upon them, whereby they are juſtified, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſaved: for, theſe two are here made the great ends of Chriſt's death, <hi>that we being dead</hi> (to wit, being made ſo in a ſpiritual ſenſe by the vertue of Chriſt's death) <hi>to ſin, might live unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> 11. As every man in his natural ſtate, before the application of the vertue of Chriſt's bloud to his ſoul, is in no leſſe danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deadly a condition, than a man that is wounded and bleeding to death, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.30. which is not to be underſtood, as if ſuch had any ſpiritual life at all, but that while they live naturally, they are altogether dead ſpiritually, and poſting toward eternal death, as a man bleeding in his wounds is to his natural death; So, it is only the vertue purchaſed by Chriſt's ſufferings that brings true health to ſinners, which conſiſteth in the pardoning of their ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. the curing of their ſpiritual diſtempers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. and enabling them like healthy men to go about ſpiritual performances, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.6. for, it is here ſupponed that ſinners are naturally in a deadly condition, and that there is no health for them, but from Chriſt's ſufferings, <hi>by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed.</hi> 12. Although we ought to conceive nothing of Chriſt's body now glorified, that may any way in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſtain the incomprehenſible glory and beauty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.11. Yet, ſo deep were the wounds that Chriſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105751:65"/>
received from the Father's juſtice, that we may ſafely conceive the impreſſion of them to be no leſſe biding in his heart, for the entertaining of ſympathy with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Ones, (who are wounded in their conſciences with the ſenſe of ſin, and fear of wrath, or, in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by ſtripes from men for their faithfulneſſe to Him) than if He had yet in his body the print of thoſe wounds to move his ſympathy towards them: for, the word here, ſignifieth the biding print, or skar of a wound after it is healed; <hi>By whoſe ſtripes ye were healed.</hi> 13. None can with patience and chearfulneſs ſuffer wrongs for Chriſt, but they that do by faith apply the vertue of his ſuffering for them to their own ſouls, for the pardoning and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of ſin, quickening of their hearts in holineſſe, and healing of their ſpiritual diſtempers; which effects of his death, are ſo ſweet to them that partake of them, that they cannot but chearfully endure the worſt that men can do againſt them, rather than do the leaſt thing that may be offenſive to Him, <hi>Who his own ſelf bear our ſins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead unto ſin, might live unto righteouſneſſe; by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed.</hi> All which the Apoſtle ſets down as ſo many motives to conſtancy in well-doing, notwithſtanding of hardeſt ſufferings.</p>

                  <p>The laſt argument to preſs upon Believers, patient ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of wrongs for Chriſt, and their duty to Him, is taken from that bleſſed change, which by the vertue of his death is made upon them: and this the Apoſtle ſets forth in two branches, The one, containing the woful caſe they were in before Converſion, to wit, That they were then wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in their ignorance and ſinful wayes, to their own deſtruction, like ſtraying ſheep: The other, holds forth the bleſſed ſtate they are now brought to, to wit, That by the powerful grace of Chriſt put forth in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, they are brought back to Him the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105751:65"/>
and Overſeer of their ſouls; and therefore they ought to follow Him, and their duty, notwithſtanding of any hardſhip they can meet with in that way. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Before converſion, the Elect, as well as others, are wandering toward their own deſtruction, unable to bring themſelves into the right way, and in hazard to be preyed upon by the roaring Lion: which condition is fitly ſet out by this ſimilitude, which the Apoſtle here makes uſe of from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>Ye were as ſheep going aſtray.</hi> 2. True converſion is that change which Chriſt worketh upon ſinners, whereby they are made not only to turn their back upon their former ſinful courſes, but alſo to betake themſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeking to enjoy his favour and fellowſhip, ſubmitting to Him, as their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Guide, and reſigning themſelves to be at his diſpoſal: for, ſo the Apoſtle here deſcribes it, <hi>Ye were as ſheep going astray, but are now returned to the Shepherd.</hi> 3. This bleſſed change which is made upon ſinners in converſion, is that which doth evidence to them that they have received the healing vertue which flows from the wounds of Chriſt to his Redeemed Ones; None elſe can eſteem themſelves healed by his ſtripes, but thoſe that find themſelves brought back from their former ſinfull courſes, and made to follow Him as their Leader: for, after the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>by his ſtripes ye were healed,</hi> he addeth this, as the evidence thereof, <hi>for ye were as ſheep go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtray, but are now returned to the Shepherd.</hi> 4. Thoſe whom Chriſt's powerfull grace hath thus turned toward Him, ſhall find Him prove himſelf to them a good and faithful Shepherd, and Ruler, as the word alſo ſignifieth, reclaiming them from their wanderings, not only before their converſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4. but likewiſe after it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.176. providing plenty of wholſom food for them as his flock, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tenderly leading, and bearing them in his boſom, in their ſick and weak conditions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.6. and ſo protecting and defending them, that none can pluck them out of his hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. for, He to whom they are returned, is, <hi>the Shepherd of their ſouls.</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:105751:66"/>
5. It is not any one relation among the creatures that can ſufficiently ſet out what Jeſus Chriſt will prove himſelf to be unto true Converts, all the uſefulneſſe and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is but ſcattered among all the relations which one creature hath to another, being but ſhadows of what he is to them that are truly turned to Him: for, the Apoſtle ſaith, they are returned to Him, who is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Shepherd, but their <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or Overſeer, who foreſees and guards them againſt hazards, ſo far as is fitting, and furniſheth them with all neceſſary proviſion in his ſervice, and ſo proves himſelf the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, <hi>of their ſouls.</hi> 6. As the Believers outward man, and the leaſt thing that doth concern the ſame, is cared for, and reſpected by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.30. So, He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to commend his reſpect, and overſight to them, mainly in reference to their ſouls, which are their better part, the welfare whereof neceſſarily bringeth along with it the welfare of the body; and, their ſouls being beyond peril, That may make them chearfully adventure upon bodily hazards in following Him, <hi>who is the Shepherd and Biſhop of their ſouls.</hi> 7 That which engageth the hearts of ſinners to love Jeſus Chriſt, and out of love to Him, to follow their duty through hardeſt ſufferings, is, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently renewed ſenſe of their woful condition wherein ſometimes they were, and of the bleſſedneſſe and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of that ſtate whereunto his grace hath brought them: for, after the Apoſtle had repreſented this change to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. as a motive to holineſſe, he doth here hold it forth again as a motive to conſtancy in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, notwithſtanding of ſufferings; <hi>For ye were as ſheep going aſtray, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Biſhop of your ſouls.</hi>

               <p>THis Chapter hath three parts: In the firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the duties of married perſons, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preſſeth upon Chriſtian Women, firſt That they ſhould make conſcience of duty to their Husbands, though they were Pagans, that ſo they might be gained to fall in love with Chriſtianity, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. by the ſight of their chaſt and religious carriage, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That they ſhould not be much taken up with trimming of their bodies, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. But, thirdly, That their prime care ſhould be to have their ſouls adorned with grace, eſpecially, meekneſſe: becauſe, 1. that's an ornament durable: and, 2. it's in high eſteem with God, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. So ſhould they reſemble holy Women recorded in Scripture, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and prove themſelves heirs of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah's</hi> bleſſedneſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Next, he exhorteth Husbands to a wiſe and tender walking toward them, by ſome arguments, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond part, he exhorteth all Chriſtians, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their relations be, to the exerciſe of ſuch graces and duties of holineſſe as ſerve for keeping up a comfortable communion among themſelves, and with the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and diſſwadeth them from ſome evils that might mar the ſame: Becauſe, firſt, they were all called to inherite the ſame bleſſedneſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And, ſecondly, becauſe a holy walking with God, and a peaceable carriage toward others, is the only way to ſweeten the lives of Chriſtians under all their troubles, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. Thirdly, that, that was the way to have God's favourable providence watching over them for good. Fourthly, to get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance to their prayers. And, fifthly, to eſchew his wrath, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The third part, containeth ſeveral motives to conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in holineſſe, and encouragements againſt ſuffering in that way: As, firſt, that well-doing was the way to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward off the evil of all their troubles, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105751:67"/>
that no trouble for well-doing ſhould hinder, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promove their bleſſedneſſe: to which encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Apoſtle ſubjoyneth ſix directions, for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right carriage under ſuffering. Firſt, that they ſhould labour to baniſh the fear of fleſh, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they ſhould adore the holineſſe of God in carving out a ſuffering lot for them. Thirdly, that they ſhould timouſly enrich themſelves with the knowledge of the Truth, ſo as they might be able to give a reaſon of what they ſuffered for. Fourthly, that they ſhould manifeſt meekneſſe toward their perſecutors. And, fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, entertain fear of their own miſcarriage, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhould labour ſtill to keep a good conſcience under their ſuffering, ſo ſhould their carriage convince and make aſhamed their very perſecutors, which is their third encouragement, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Fourthly, that their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings after this manner, ſhould prove much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to them, than if they were procured by their own miſcarriage. Fifthly, that the good will of God had the carving out of theſe ſufferings, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Sixthly, that innocent Jeſus Chriſt had ſuffered to the death for reconciling them to God, and for the applying of his purchaſe, was raiſed by the power of his Spirit, or God-head, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Seventhly, that there are many ſouls now impriſoned in Hell, for ſlighting ſuch Truths as Chriſt's Spirit ſpeaking through <hi>Noah,</hi> and others of his Servants, had preſt upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. Eighthly, that the ſpiritual ſafety of Believers from the deluge of Gods wrath was made no leſſe ſure to them by their Baptiſm, and the work of Chriſt's Spirit with it, than the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſafety of <hi>Noah,</hi> and thoſe few perſons with him, from the floud, was made ſure to them by the Ark, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. And, ninthly, that their Surety is now in higheſt power and glory, that he may bear them through all their troubles, and poſſeſſe them in that ſalvation, which he hath purchaſed for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. All which prove, that Believers ought to follow their duty to him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of all ſufferings for him.</p>

                  <p>THe Apoſtle, being to point out the duties of married perſons, he beginneth with, and inſiſteth moſt upon the duties of the Women, partly, becauſe they had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt diſcouragements; and partly, becauſe their making conſcience of their duty was the beſt means to provoke their Husbands to their duty. Upon them he preſſeth ſubjection, or dutifulneſſe to their Husbands, by two arguments: The firſt is, Becauſe their obligation to their duty was no leſs ſtrait, than the obligation of others who ſtood in any of thoſe relations, mentioned in the former Chapter. The ſecond is, Becauſe their unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Husbands might, through Gods bleſſing, be moved to receive the Goſpel, which formerly they had rejected, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. providing, they did mark nothing but chaſtity and holineſſe, joyned with the fear of God, and reverence toward themſelves, ſhining in the converſation of their Wives, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And therefore Chriſtian Women had reaſon to make conſcience of duties, even toward their Pagan-Husbands. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. They that would rightly divide the Word of Truth among the Lord's People, muſt not content themſelves to preſſe the duties of holineſſe in general, as they concern all Chriſtians, but muſt learn in their Doctrine to come down to the loweſt relations that are among the Lord's People, and to point out the particular duties of theſe, it being in the diſcharge of ſuch duties mainly that Religion is adorned, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. Therefore, the Apoſtle, after he hath ſpoken at large of the duties of holineſſe, belonging to all in general, he comes, among other relations, to point out the duties of wives to their husbands; <hi>Likewiſe, ye wives, be ſubject, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The ſum of a Womans duty to her Husband, is, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb facs="tcp:105751:68"/>
which doth conſiſt in a reverend eſteem of him, as of one placed by the Lord in a degree of ſuperiority above her, which will produce reverent ſpeaking of him, and to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and in giving obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in things lawfull, both which are in the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this word, whereby the Apoſtle expreſſeth the whole duty of Wives to their Husbands, <hi>Likewiſe, ye wives, be ſubject to your own huſbands.</hi> 3. However there be difference among thoſe relations that are betwixt the Lord's People, ſome of them having more of dominion and ſubjection in them, as thoſe laſt mentioned in the former Chapter, betwixt Magiſtrates and Subjects, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Servants, others of them having more of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and love in them, as this which is here betwixt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife; Yet, the obligation to the duties of the latter ſort is no leſſe ſtrict, than to the duties of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, both being enjoyned by the ſame authoritie, and ſo to be made conſcience of upon the ſame hazard: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle preſſeth the duty of Women to their Husbands by ſuch an expreſſion, as imports a like ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of tye upon them to their duty, as was upon thoſe mentioned in the laſt part of the former Chapter, <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ye wives, be ſubject, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The wickedneſſe and diſobedience to the Goſpel of any married perſon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may draw themſelves under the curſe of God, Yet it doth neither looſe the relation, nor exempt the other party from their duty (excepting in the caſe of Adultery, and lawful divorce thereupon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.32. or wilful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.15.) but doth rather tye the better party the more ſtrictly to a conſcionable diſcharge of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the conviction or gaining of the other party: for, though the Apoſtle here doth ſuppone Husbands, ſome of them at leaſt, to be diſobedient to the Word, Yet, he preſſeth upon their Wives, dutifulneſs to them, as to their own Hubands; <hi>Be in ſubjection to your own huſbands, that if any obey not the Word, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Although the publick Miniſtery of the Word, be the ordinary and principal mean of ſinners converſion to the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15, 17.

Yet the Lord may, and ſometimes doth make uſe of the pains of private Chriſtians for that effect: for, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned that they who obey not the Word, may be won to obey it <hi>by the converſation of their wives.</hi> 6. Although the Children of the Lord be bound to deal with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, or profane, among whom they live, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and conference, commending Chriſt to them, and pointing out the way of attaining acquaintance and communion with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.29, 30. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.15, 16. Yet, it is mainly a converſation ſuitable to the Word that God uſeth to bleſſe, for gaining of ſuch to fall in love with Religion, without which the beſt diſcourſes will rather harden folk in ſin, than reclaim them from their ſinful wayes; Therefore the Apoſtle here preſſeth practical duties upon Chriſtian Women, as the beſt way to gain their unbelieving Husbands, <hi>That if any obey not the Word, they may be won by the converſation of the wives: while they behold your chast converſation, &amp;c.</hi> 7. The Lord's People ought not to quit their hopes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of thoſe, who have not hitherto been perſwaded by the Word to follow the directions thereof, neither yet do believe the Truths revealed in it, But they ought to continue their pains toward thoſe with whom the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſtery doth not prevail: for, even to theſe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands whom the Apoſtle ſupponeth to be unbelievers, diſobedient to the Word, and ſuch as will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereby, (as the word here ſignifieth) he pleads for duty from their Wives, in hopes of gaining them thereby, <hi>That if any obey not the Word, they may without the Word be won by the converſation of the wives.</hi> 8. The winning of a ſinner to Jeſus Chriſt, is an imployment full of gain and advantage, (as the word here tranſlated <hi>to be won,</hi> ſignifieth) both to the ſinner it ſelf, who is thereby made partaker of the true riches, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. and to thoſe who are inſtrumental in that work, in regard of the comfort they may have from them, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.1. and the reward they ſhall have from God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. and therefore it ought to be mannaged with a great deal of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105751:69"/>
ſpiritual policy and skill, as the ſame word alſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; <hi>That if any obey not the Word, &amp;c. they may be won.</hi> 9. There is no part of a Chriſtians converſation ſo prevalent to gain on-lookers to fall in love with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as that wherein the duties which we owe to others, in the relation we have to them, doth ſhine: for, theſe two, <hi>chaſtity</hi> (which in the peculiar ſignification of it, is one main duty of the Wife in reference to her Husband) and <hi>fear,</hi> (ſignifying reverence to a ſuperiour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7.) are the qualities of a chriſtian converſation, which the Spirit of God here condeſcends upon, as moſt prevalent for gaining unbelievers to fall in love with Religion; <hi>They may be won, while they behold your chaſt converſation, coupled with fear.</hi> 10. Carnal men do very accurately pry into all the ſecrets of the practice of thoſe that are religious, which though it be done by them, that they may find occaſion againſt the Godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.6. who ſhould therefore be the more circumſpect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. and the more earneſt for God's teaching, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.11. Yet the Lord may make uſe of it contrary to their intention, to be a mean of much good to their ſouls: for, the word which the Apoſtle uſes here, <hi>while they behold,</hi> ſignifieth very accurately to pry into, and ſeriouſly to conſider a thing: upon which, the Apoſtle may be ſafely conceived to lay ſome weight for moving Chriſtian Women to the more holy circumſpection in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which the Lord might bleſſe for gaining of their Husbands, <hi>While they behold your chaſt converſation.</hi> 11. There is no true purity or holineſſe of converſation, which doth not flow from fear of offending God in the heart, by which Chriſtians depart from evil in their practice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.6. Nor is there any true fear of God in the heart, where, the converſation is not in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure holy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. for, though this chaſtity and fear, of Chriſtian Women here ſpoken of, may be taken with a ſpecial reſpect to their Husbands, Yet the words are of a larger ſignification, and muſt neceſſarily include holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, and fear of offending God in the heart, what
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105751:69"/>
ever they might ſuffer from their Husbands, the one whereof cannot be ſeparated from the other, <hi>A chaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, coupled with fear.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle giveth here two further directions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Women for attaining to ſuch a converſation, as, through the Lord's bleſſing, might prove a mean of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their unbelieving Husbands: The one is negative, that they ſhould not be too curious, and ſuperfluous, in trimming their outward man. The other is poſitive, that their great pains ſhould be to have their inward man adorned with the grace of God, eſpecially meekneſſe and peaceableneſſe of ſpirit, in reference to their Husbands, and the Lord's diſpenſation in tying them to ſuch men, and to a croſſe with them: which laſt, he preſſeth by two arguments, The firſt is, that this was an ornament that would not wax old as others do. The ſecond is, that it is in very high eſteem with the Lord, and therefore as they deſired to gain their husbands by their outward carriage, their great care ſhould be to attain to a right frame of ſpirit within. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Even the Children of the Lord are in hazard to offend Him and others, in the matter of their apparrel, while they labour not to have the ſame ſuitable to their ſeveral ranks and conditions, which God would have diſtinguiſhed in ſome meaſure by apparrel, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.14. while they affect a newneſſe and ſtrangeneſſe, whether in the kind of their apparel, or in their way of uſing of it, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.8. and when much time and expences are waſted about appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, as is imported in the Apoſtle's words here. In all which, and the like caſes, the Lord's People are ready to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105751:70"/>
offend in the matter of their apparel; and that becauſe there is in them much unſubdued pride and vanity rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to manifeſt it ſelf that way, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.16, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and becauſe they forget, that apparel is given to make them aſhamed in remembrance of their ſin, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9, 14. for, the hazard of offending (by waſting both time and means) is imported in this diſſwaſive of the Apoſtle; <hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward adorning, of plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the hair, and wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel.</hi> 2. Although the Lord allow perſons who are in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency above others, to have ornaments beyond neceſſity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>0, 21, 22. and others to have more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary at ſome ſpecial occaſions, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.30. and all of his People to provide for things honeſt in the ſight of all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17. Yet, when any Profeſſor of Religion becomes exceſſive in the uſe of his liberty in theſe things, he will be ſo far from commending Religion to others thereby, that his practice will rather be a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto others to fall in love with it, who may, or will readily take occaſion thence, to think that Chriſtians have no better things to take them up, than theſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they waſt their time, pains and means: for, from this evil the Apoſtle here diſſwades Chriſtian Women, as they would gain their Heathen Husbands; import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their vanity and exceſſe in the matter of their apparel, would rather hinder them, than gain them to fall in love with Chriſtianity; <hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward adorning, of plaiting the hair, &amp;c.</hi> 3. They that would by their outward carriage, commend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and win others to fall in love therewith, muſt have their prime care exerciſed about their heart, which, if it be adorned with the graces of God's Spirit in life and practice, the converſation cannot but be lovely to all rightly diſcerning on-lookers: for, the Apoſtle, having told thoſe believing Women before, that it was their converſation mainly which would gain their Husbands, he now condeſcendeth upon the way of attaining to ſuch a converſation, <hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105751:70"/>
adorning, &amp;c. but let it be the hidden man of the heart,</hi> 4. Thoſe that waſt much time, pains and means, in decking and trimming of their bodies, do ordinarily neglect their ſouls, leaving theſe in a diſorderly, ſordid and filthy condition: for, the Apoſtle, diſſwading from the one, and (in oppoſition thereto) perſwading to the other, importeth the inconſiſtency of ſuch an adorning of the outward man, with the adorning of the inward; <hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward adorning, &amp;c. but let it be the hidden man of the heart.</hi> 5. The Lord hath been pleaſed to hide the hearts of every one, from the knowledge of another, who therefore ought not by their raſh judging, and cenſuring of the inward frame and ſtate of others, to invade the Lord's prerogative of ſearching the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. but ought to beſtow much pains, for keeping in a right frame their own hearts, which are hid from all eyes but God's, as a prime evidence of their ſincerity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6, 7. Therefore the inward frame of the ſpirit, is here called, <hi>The hidden man of the heart.</hi> 6. That which mainly makes the carriage of a Profeſſor of Religion a mean to gain others to Jeſus Chriſt, is, the exerciſe of the graces of God's Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, eſpecially meekneſſe and quietneſſe of ſpirit; by the former whereof, (to wit, meekneſſe) they keep down their paſſions from riſing againſt others that wrong them, or againſt the Lord's diſpenſation in exerciſing them more hardly than others, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.2, 3. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo they eſſay all amicable and loving wayes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming ſuch as do wrong them, before they go to the rigor of juſtice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. and by the latter, (to wit, quietneſſe of ſpirit) they do eſchew all needleſſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of others, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. all raſhneſſe in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.36. all medling with things not belonging to them, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.11. and all expreſſions of miſcontent with that lot which the Lord hath carved out to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.2. All which are here required of Chriſtian Women, tied to unbelieving and profane Husbands, as ſpecial means of gaining them to Chriſt: for, in order
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105751:71"/>
to their gaining, the Apoſtle thus exhorteth the Wives, to put on the ornament <hi>of a meek and quiet ſpirit.</hi> 7. Where ſuch a gracious frame of ſpirit is within, as the Apoſtle here exhorteth Chriſtian Women to labour for, it will have viſible effects that may be diſcerned without: for, the Apoſtle exhorteth Chriſtian Wives to the ſtudy of meekneſſe and quietneſſe of ſpirit, as a mean to gain their unbelieving Husbands, which it could not prove, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the effects thereof were viſible in their carriage. 8. The grace of Chriſt is ſuch an ornament, as being once put upon the ſoul, doth never altogether fade or wax old; The conſideration whereof ſhould make Chriſtians more careful to have it in exerciſe in their hearts, than to have on the beſt of their ornaments which will ſoon wear and wax old: for, as an argument to move Chriſtians to put on this adorning of Gods grace, the Apoſtle affirms it to be that <hi>which is incorruptible.</hi> 9. Although every grace be the Lords own free gift, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. and the moſt Gracious cannot properly be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Him, <hi>Job</hi> 22.2. Yet, He is pleaſed to eſteem of his own grace, and graciouſly to reward the perſons to whom He gives it, as if it were of much worth to Him; The conſideration whereof, ſhould heighten the eſteem of grace in our hearts, and quicken us to pains for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and increaſing of it: for this end is this adorning of a meek and quiet ſpirit here commended from this, <hi>that it is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi>

                  <p>Here are two further arguments, whereby the Apoſtle preſſeth upon Chriſtian Women the ſtudy of ſuch a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as might prove a mean of gaining their wicked
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105751:71"/>
Husbands; The one is taken from the example of holy believing VVomen, regiſtred in Scripture, who counted it their beſt ornament to manifeſt their holineſſe and faith, by their dutifulneſſe to their Husbands; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Sarah,</hi> who teſtified her obedience to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by her reſpective and reverend language to him: The other argument, is from the advantage of ſuch a carriage, that if they did imitate theſe holy Women, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Sarah,</hi> in dutifulneſſe to their Husbands, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any terror from them, they ſhould prove themſelves heirs of <hi>Sarah's</hi> bleſſedneſſe. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Children of the Lord have not only need of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to preſſe their duty upon them, but likewiſe of the examples of others held forth to them, who have gone before them in the practiſe of theſe duties, that ſo they may apprehend them feaſible, ſeing others have attained to them; and ſweet, ſeing others have chearfully pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed them; and the neglect of them hazardous, ſince theſe who have made conſcience of them, may be brought as witneſſes againſt the neglecters of them: Therefore, after the Apoſtle hath preſt, by precepts and reaſons, the duty of believing Women to their Husbands, he here beareth in the ſame further by the example of the Saints: for, after this manner alſo the holy Women in the old time, <hi>who truſted in God, adorned themſelves, being in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their own huſbands.</hi> 2. The approven examples of the moſt eminent of the Saints, making conſcience of moral duties, which are regiſtred in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are obligatory under the New to the meaneſt of Believers in Chriſt, who are not by their Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty freed from imitating them in theſe: for, here the Apoſtle preſſeth upon Chriſtian Women, dutifulneſſe to their Husbands, from the example of holy Women under the Old Teſtament, and particularly <hi>Sarah,</hi> who was an eminent, and, in ſome reſpects, an extraordinary perſon; <hi>For after this manner in the old time the holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo, &amp;c. Even as Sarah, &amp;c.</hi> 3. There is no true holineſſe, which hath not Faith in God for the fountain
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105751:72"/>
and root of it, whereby the heart relieth on God for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for the duties of holineſſe, and encouragement againſt difficulties in the way thereof; Nor, is there any real truſting in God, which hath not for the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, holineſſe, conſiſting in the ſtudy of abſtenance from every known ſin, and endeavour after every known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for, from theſe two joyntly, are thoſe ancient Believers deſcribed, as examples to be imitated by others; <hi>Holy Women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who truſted in God.</hi> 4.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d his People; the conſcionable diſcharge whereof, doth prove the principal ornament of Profeſſors: for, here the Apoſtle ſets forth thoſe ancient believing Women, as in their beſt ornaments, while they are evidencing their holineſſe, and truſting in God, by their dutifulneſſe to their Husbands, to be imitated by Chriſtian Women under the Goſpel, <hi>The holy Women who truſted in God, adorned themſelves, being in ſubjection to their Huſbands.</hi> 5. The Lord takes notice of the leaſt act of ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commands, even when it is mixed with many ſinful failings, which he paſſeth in penitents, and would not have any of his People caſt at any good in others, nor be the leſſe careful to imitate it, that they do diſcern much miſcarriage joyned with it: for, in that paſſage of <hi>Sarah's, Gen.</hi> 18.12. which is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to, there are many ſinful failings, and little thing commendable, beſide that one word, evidencing her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to her Husband, which the Lord here regiſtreth for her commendation and others imitation, hiding the faults that were therewith; <hi>Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him, Lord.</hi> 6. The want of theſe qualifications in parties to whom the Lord's People have relation, which have been eminent in others, doth not exempt them from theſe duties, which by vertue of that relation have been performed to others, endued with theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: for, here the Apoſtle, from <hi>Sarah's</hi> reverencing of <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> an extraordinary and eminently gracious
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105751:72"/>
man, inferreth upon Chriſtian Women reverence to their wicked infidel Husbands; <hi>Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him, Lord.</hi> 7. When we obtain grace from the Lord, to follow the footſteps of the Saints, regiſtred in Scripture, eſpecially in the faithful diſcharge of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our particular ſtations and relations, then do we prove our ſelves to be partakers of the ſame ſpiritual pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges with them, and heirs of the ſame eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe which they now poſſeſs: for, as thoſe who imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the faith and obedience of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are for that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, 9, 29. So, theſe Women here, who imitate <hi>Sarah</hi> in well-doing, particularly, in obedience to their Husbands, are called her daughters, <hi>Whoſe daughters ye are as long as ye do well,</hi> which is not to be underſtood, as if they were caſt out of the number of her daughters for every ſhort-coming in their duty, but that it is in the way of their duty, that they will clear to themſelves their right to her bleſſedneſs, and enjoy the ſenſe of their intereſt in the ſpiritual pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which ſhe had. 8. They that reſolve to hold on in the way of well-doing, may reſolve to meet with as much of terror and afrightment therein, as wicked men can make them; yea, even from thoſe of their neareſt relations, whoſe enmity againſt godlineſſe, before the Lord change them, is greater, than any natural affection they have to thoſe they are moſt ſtrictly tied unto: for, it is mainly againſt the terror and amazement of wicked Husbands, that the Apoſtle here guards Chriſtian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, encouraging them by this, that they ſhould prove themſelves daughters of <hi>Sarah,</hi> if they held on in their duty, <hi>and were not afraid of any amazement.</hi> 9. It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in the way of duty, when there is not only ſmall appearance of ſucceſſe, but much terrible oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from wicked men in following of it, which mainly cleareth to Believers their right to the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for, this the Apoſtle preſſeth upon Chriſtian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as that which would prove them daughters of <hi>Sarah,</hi> that is, co-heirs with her of the heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,

                  <p>In the next place, the Apoſtle preſſeth the duties of Husbands to their Wives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he comprehendeth in two branches: Firſt, That they ſhould manifeſt a ſpecial meaſure of prudence and heavenly wiſdom in converſing with them; And ſecondly, that they ſhould ſeaſon their authority over them with tenderneſs and reſpect to them: both which he preſſeth by ſeveral arguments, 1. From the ſtrictneſſe of their obligation to theſe duties, which was the ſame with that of the Wives to theirs. 2. From the weakneſſe and infirmity of the Women, which calls for the more wiſe and tender dealing. 3. From the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of both in partaking of ſpiritual and eternal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. And, 4. from the hazard of the neglect of thoſe duties, to wit, the interrupting of their ſervice to God, particularly the marring of their acceſs to him in prayer. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Husbands are no leſſe ſtrictly tied to duty toward their Wives, than the Wives are to duty toward them, or any inferiour toward their ſuperiour; and therefore, they ought not to make their ſuperiority a pretence to the neglect of their duty, as if their Wives were tied, and themſelves left at liberty: for, the Apoſtle uſeth the ſame word in preſſing the duty of Husbands to their Wives, which he did before in preſſing the duty of Wives to their Husbands, and of Servants to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; <hi>Likewiſe, ye husbands.</hi> 2. It is the duty of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to cohabit with their Wives, and to labour for much prudence and wiſdom in converſing with them, that they may not only know their own duty toward them, but may be able to inſtruct them in theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.35. that they may diſcern how far to intruſt them

with their affairs and counſels, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.11. and how far they ought to keep up the ſame from them, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.5. and that they do not rule them according to their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and will, but according to that wiſe rule ſet down in the Word: for, the Apoſtle here preſſeth upon Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, both cohabitation, and wiſe walking with their Wives; <hi>Ye husbands, dwell with them according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> 3. There is not only love required of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band toward the Wife, but likewiſe ſome reſpect and honour, ſuch as makes them ſignifie their ſympathy with them under their croſſes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.8. their high eſteem of the vertues they diſcern in them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.28. and ſuch as may conciliate reſpect to them from the reſt of the family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.6. for, this is the other branch of the duty of Husbands, <hi>giving honour unto the Wife.</hi> 4. It hath pleaſed the Lord to exerciſe the Woman with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial meaſure of weakneſſe and infirmity, both natural, by impoſing upon her much pain and labour in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth and educating of Children, and moral, by giving her fewer opportunities than the Man hath of means for perfecting of her natural parts, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are not ordinarily ſo ſtrong in her as in the Man: in which reſpects ſhe is here called <hi>the weaker veſſel.</hi> 5. The conſideration of this weakneſſe of the Woman ſhould be ſo far from making Husbands to deſpiſe and ſlight them, that by the contrary it ſhould increaſe their reſpect to them, conſidering that by reaſon thereof they are the more eaſily cruſhed and broken in their ſpirits, eſpecially by the auſtere and undutiful carriage of their Husbands, and the more apt to apprehend themſelves ſlighted: for, ſo it is here made an argument to procure reſpect to them from their Husbands, <hi>giving honour unto the Wife, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the weaker veſſel.</hi> 6. Both the work of God's ſaving grace in his own, which is here called the grace of life, becauſe it quickens the ſoul, where it is, for ſpiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and clears its right to eternal life; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eternal life it ſelf, which may be ſafely conceived to be comprehended in the ſame expreſſion, is the free gift
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105751:74"/>
of God's grace, proceeding meerly from his favour and love, beſtowing the ſame upon ſinners, as their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance never to be taken from them: for, of both theſe the Apoſtle may be underſtood, while he calleth Chriſtian Women, and their Husbands, to whom he ſpeaketh, as being Believers, <hi>Heirs together of the grace of life.</hi> 7. The difference of ſex, or outward condition, among the Lord's People, doth not hinder their equality in the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpiritual and eternal priviledges, which free grace doth beſtow without reſpect to theſe differences, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. for, here Husbands and Wives are called <hi>Heirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the grace of life.</hi> 8. The conſideration of this equality ſhould ſtrongly move ſuperiours to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of duty toward their inferiours, conſidering, that becauſe of this equality, their inferiours are no leſſe dear to God than themſelves, and that they are fellow-heirs with them of that which is much better than any thing of a temporary concernment, wherin they do excel them: for, this is here brought as an argument of Husbands dutifulneſſe to their Wives, <hi>That they are heirs together of the grace of life.</hi> 9. Although none can be ſo infallibly perſwaded of anothers being in the ſtate of grace and ſalvation, as they may be of their own, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.17. Yet ought every Profeſſor to entertain ſo much charity of another, concerning that, as may make them no leſſe conſcionable in every duty toward them, than if they were ſuch, and not upon ſlender grounds to queſtion the ſame, or admit of thoughts to the contrary, leſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Satan make them apprehend exemption from duty toward them: for, ſo much is imported here, while Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are exhorted to duty toward their Wives, and that becauſe they ought to judge them in charity, <hi>Heirs with them of the grace of life.</hi> 10. When Chriſtians are not making conſcience of the faithful diſcharge of the duties of their particular relations, eſpecially of this betwixt Husband and Wife, then the duties of God's Service, chiefly in their families, and in ſecret, will either be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, or the ſucceſſe of them marred; for, how-ever
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105751:74"/>
the one party may be more innocent than the other, yet the guilt of the injuring party, and the grief and paſſion of the injured, will not only indiſpoſe the hearts of both for duties, and mar their hearty joyning in them; but will alſo readily cut off (as the word here rendred, <hi>to hinder,</hi> ſignifieth) the very external performance of the duty of Prayer (under which all other religious performances may be comprehended) and mar their acceſſe to God, and the ſucceſſe of their duties: for, ſo much is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this laſt reaſon, <hi>That your prayers be not hindred.</hi> 11. The more conſcionable Chriſtians are by the grace of God enabled to be, in the diſcharge of the particular duties of their ſeveral relations, the more acceſſe to God, and ſucceſſe of all their religious performances may they expect: for, this motive, as it imports the hazard to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon the neglect of duties of that ſort, ſo it imports alſo the advantage to follow upon the conſcionable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof, to wit, that their <hi>Prayers ſhould not be hindred.</hi>

                  <p>Here is the ſecond part of the Chapter, wherein the Apoſtle exhorteth to the exerciſe of ſuch graces and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of holineſſe, as do concern every Chriſtian; and do ſerve in a ſpecial way for keeping up a profitable and comfortable communion with God and with his people: of which ſort, the Apoſtle condeſcendeth upon ſeven, Firſt, That they ſhould labour for unity of judgement among themſelves. Secondly that they ſhould be affected with one anothers condition, as if it were their own. Thirdly, that their love one to another ſhould reſemble that which is among Brethren. Fourthly, that they ſhould pity the infirmities one of another. Fifthly, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105751:75"/>
they ſhould ſhew themſelves courteous in their carriage, and eaſie to be converſed with, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Sixthly, that they ſhould not ſtudy to requite mutual injuries: But, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, rather ſeek the happineſſe of them that wrong them. All which, eſpecially the laſt two, the Apoſtle preſſeth by this reaſon, that they were all called to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit one common bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although compleat oneneſſe of judgment cannot be expected among the Lord's People, whileſt knowledge is imperfect in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. and diſpenſed in different meaſures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. Yet it ought to be the ſincere endeavour of every one, ſo to drink-in the knowledge of all ſaving and neceſſary Truths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to imploy their power, according to their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to make all others do the ſame, that they may be, ſo far as is poſſible, as if one and the ſame mind were in them all, (as the word here ſignifieth) which is in ſome good meaſure attained, when Chriſtians do agree in all ſaving and fundamental Truths, and when their prime projects and deſigns (as the word alſo ſignifieth) do meet in one, to wit, the advancement of the glory of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; without which unity of judgment, there doth ordinarily follow among the Lord's People aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affection, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15, 16. and a loſſe of the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Chriſt's Spirit, which uſes to be given through their communion among themſelves, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.1, 2. for, this is it which the Apoſtle here expreſly preſſeth, <hi>Finally, be all of one mind.</hi> 2. Every one of the Children of the Lord, ought to be ſo affected with the condition of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if it were their own, mourning with, and for one another in affliction, as if they were afflicted with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. rejoycing in, and praiſing for, their welfare, as if they were in their caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. conſidering, that they are all members of one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. and, that this ſympathizing frame of ſpirit is a ſpecial part of our conformity to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. for, this is the ſecond duty here preſſed, <hi>having compaſſion one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> 3. Whatever differences for worldly reſpects, or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105751:75"/>
meaſures of ſpiritual gifts, there may be among the Children of the Lord, there ſhould be, notwithſtanding, ſuch affection and love in the moſt eminent and ſtrongeſt, toward the meaneſt and weakeſt, as is among Brethren, they being all Children of one Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. and the weakeſt owned by Chriſt as his Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. and co-heirs, not only with the ſtrongeſt, but with Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, of everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. and therefore that meaſure of affection which may be found among men without the Church, who have not put off humanity, is not ſufficient for one of the Lord's People toward another: for, this is the third duty here preſſed, <hi>Love as Brethren.</hi> 4. There can neither be unity, ſympathy, nor brotherly love among the Lord's People, unleſſe they have hearts to pity the infirmities one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſome proueneſſe of ſpirit to do good to others, even when they deſerve the contrary at their hands: for, this word, whereby the Apoſtle preſſeth the fourth duty, is often uſed to ſignifie Chriſt's compaſſion to his own, which is manifeſted in beſtowing favours notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of provocations, and ſignifieth ſuch a tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe, as is evidenced by forgiving of wrongs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. <hi>be pitiful.</hi> 5. They that would keep up a ſweet and profitable ſociety with others of the Lord's People, muſt ſhew themſelves affable and pleaſant in their carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, ſtudying to ſpeak and do, ſo far as they may with a good conſcience, what may be acceptable, and engaging of their affections to them: for, this duty, which is the laſt in the eight Verſe, as alſo all the former, may be taken in reference to the keeping up of ſociety with others; <hi>be courteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Even thoſe who have attained to ſuch a carriage, as ought in all reaſon to be lovely, and honoured by all with whom they converſe, may, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, reſolve to meet with much hard uſage, and many ſlanders: for, the Apoſtle preſſeth here, patience, in the ſixth place, importing, that they who had attained to all the former ſive, would, notwithſtanding, have ado
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105751:76"/>
with their patience, <hi>Not rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing.</hi> 2. The Children of the Lord may reſolve, not only to meet with hard uſage, and bitter language, from the profane, or thoſe that are without, but even from their fellow-Profeſſors, whether Hypocrites, who will ſtill be maligning the ſincere, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. or even truly gracious, whoſe corruptions oppoſe grace in others, <hi>Job</hi> 16.20. for, this laſt grace of patience, preſt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the eight Verſe, cannot well be taken in reference to other perſons, than theſe, in reference to whom the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the former graces or duties were preſſed, which do clearly relate to other Profeſſors; and therefore this imports, that they might be tried both with evil deeds and words, from ſuch, while the Apoſtle thus dehorteth, <hi>Not rendring evil for evil or railing for railing.</hi> 3. However the beſt of the Children of the Lord, are prone to ſtudy revenge, and requital of private injuries, as is ſupponed in this diſſwaſive; Yet muſt they not allow themſelves in ſo doing, as they love their own, and others peace, and deſire to eſchew the diſpleaſure of God for uſurping his place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.2. <hi>Not rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing.</hi> 4. So far ſhould the Lord's People be from the ſtudy of private revenge, and retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wrongs done by one of them againſt another, that by the contrary the greateſt perſonal wrong by word or deed, ſhould not hinder one of them, to procure the beſtowing of bleſſings, if they be able, upon another, to commend in them what they can diſcern to be praiſe-worthy, or to pray for their true bleſſedneſſe, which is a ſpecial draught of the Image of the Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45. All which, is in the ſignification of this word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtle expreſſeth the duty oppoſite to rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing; <hi>but contrariwiſe, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> 5. The conſideration of that everlaſting bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which conſiſteth in the clear viſion, and full frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in Chriſt through the Spirit, and which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who are naturally under the curſe, are called to poſſeſſe, as their free-gifted inheritance (as the word here
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105751:76"/>
tranſlated, <hi>to inherit,</hi> ſignifies) ſhould comfort the hearts of Believers againſt the worſt uſage, and vileſt reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of men, which will be ſufficiently made up when they come to poſſeſs that bleſſedneſs: the thoughts wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould take them off from all ſtudy of revenge, toward thoſe who may be heirs with them of the ſame inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and who could never wrong them ſo far, as they have wronged the Lord, who hath graciouſly called them to poſſeſs that free-gifted inheritance: for, this is here propoſed by the Apoſtle, as an argument to patience under wrongs, and a diſſwaſive from revenge among the Lord's people: for, even <hi>hereunto were ye called, that ye ſhould inherit a bleſſing.</hi>

                  <p>Here is a ſecond motive to the ſtudy of the duties for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly preſſed, to wit, That that ſtudy was the way to have a ſweet life, and many good dayes in communion with the Lord, notwithſtanding of all their troubles: And this argument is taken out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12, 13. and doth contain four ſeveral directions, for clearing the way of attaining to that ſweet fellowſhip with God, and among themſelves. The firſt, is, that they ſhould watch againſt the evils of the tongue. The ſecond is, that they ſhould ſet againſt every known ſin. The third is, that they ſhould ſet about the practiſe of every known duty. And fourthly, that they ſhould earneſtly purſue peace with others of the Lord's People, So might they expect ſweet communion with himſelf. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the moſt part of men eſteem their life happy, and their dayes good enough, if they enjoy abundance of earthly comforts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7. and 49.16, 18. Yet there is no life, that deſerves the name of a life, except it be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105751:77"/>
ſweetned ſometimes with taſts of the Lord's ſpecial love; nor are there any dayes, that are worthy to be called good dayes, which are not ſpent in fellowſhip with God: for, this life, and thoſe good dayes here ſpoken of, are the ſame with taſting how gracious the Lord is, as appears, by comparing theſe words, with the ninth verſe of the Pſalm whence they are cited. 2. There is no way to live that ſweet life, and to ſee thoſe good dayes that ſinners may attain unto, even here away in communion with the Lord, but by the ſtudy of holineſſe, eſchewing every thing that grieves the Spirit of God, and aiming ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the practiſe of every thing that is well-pleaſing in his ſight: for, both theſe are here preſt as the way to <hi>have that life, and to ſee thoſe good dayes.</hi> 3. Although men are prone to count very little of the ſins of their tongue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.2, 4. Yet much of that guilt, which marreth ſweet fellowſhip with God, will be found in ſins of that kind; partly, in idle and unprofitable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, whereof men muſt give an accompt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. fooliſh talking, and jeſting which is not convenient, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.4. rigid cenſuring of, and bitter env<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All which, and the like, may be comprehended under <hi>guile;</hi> and both ſorts of ſins of the tongue, are to be abſtained from by thoſe, that would enjoy communion with the Lord: for, in order to that, this is the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>He that will love life, and ſee good dayes, let him
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105751:77"/>
refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they ſpeak no guile.</hi> 4. Were Chriſtians never ſo innocent in their diſcourſes, and watchful over their tongue, except alſo they make it their ſerious ſtudy to keep a diſtance in heart and practice from every known ſin; and that as it is evil, and contrary to the holy nature and will of God, they cannot expect to keep up that ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, which he allows upon his own: for, this is the ſecond direction neceſſary for attaining to that end, <hi>Let him eſchew evil.</hi> 5. It is not ſimple abſtinence from ſin, (ſuppoſe that could be attained to without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that fitteth ſouls for entertaining fellowſhip with God, unleſſe there be alſo joyned therewith a ſincere and univerſal aim at every thing that is well-pleaſing in the ſight of God, both in duties relating more immediately to God, and his publick matters in the world, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.16. and in duties toward others of his People, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe of our particular relations, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4. or others, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. to which theſe Scriptures give the name of doing good: for, this is the third direction for attaining and enjoying communion with God, <hi>Let him do good.</hi> 6. They that deſire to have much peace in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, muſt be very ſerious in ſtudying peace with others, both by living peaceably with them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo far as is poſſible, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to Truth, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.19. or holineſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. and procuring and cheriſhing peace among others of the Lord's People, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. both which are comprehended in this fourth direction for attaining to, and enjoying of communion with God; <hi>Let him ſeek peace, and enſue it.</hi> 7. As there will be no ſmall difficulty from Satan, our own and others corruptions, in the way of attaining and entertaining peace among the Lord's People; So none of them muſt ſtand upon their pains in the purſuit thereof, nor quit the ſame, though upon many former eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes they have not had ſucceſſe, and though peace ſeem to be flying from them.

                  <p>Here are three further arguments to preſſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned duties: The firſt is, that the watchful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God is exerciſed about them for their good, who having fled to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, do alſo walk in the way of righteouſneſſe or holineſſe formerly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. The ſecond is, that he doth favourably accept of their prayers. And the third is, that the terror and wrath of God is imployed againſt thoſe that walk in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the priviledge of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons, walking in the way of holineſſe, to have the favourable providence of God, watching over them for good; which comprehends his furniſhing of them with every thing neceſſary for their welfare, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.12. warding hazards off them, as far as ſhall be for their good, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. rendring ineffectual all oppoſition made to them, while he hath ſervice for them, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 5.5. ſupporting them under, and delivering them from all their troubles in due time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18. and making out his Covenant to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.6, 7. All which, the Scriptures cited, make clear to be comprehended in this expreſſion which holds forth their priviledges; <hi>The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous.</hi> 2.

That which makes the life of Believers a life indeed, and their dayes good dayes to them, in the midſt of many troubles, is this favourable providence of God watching over them for their good, and his gracious acceptance of their prayers through his Son: for, theſe priviledges are brought in to clear wherein that life, and thoſe good days, ſpoken of in the former words, do ſtand, even in this, that <hi>the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers.</hi> 5.

It is both lawful and neceſſary for the Lord's People to encourage their own hearts in the duties of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, by the conſideration of that ſweetneſſe which the Lord uſeth to let out to them, while they hold that way; and to deter their hearts from thoſe ſins whereunto they do ſtrongly incline, by the conſideration of the hazard abiding them that continue in ſin: for, both the gain of godlineſſe, and the hazard of ſinful courſes, is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be conſidered by them for theſe ends; for, <hi>the

                  <p>Followeth the laſt part of the Chapter, which is full of encouragement againſt ſufferings, and motives to the duties of holineſſe notwithſtanding thereof, together with ſeveral directions for attaining to a right carriage under the ſame. The firſt encouragement is, That the following of duty, notwithſtanding of ſuffering, would prove the beſt way of any to eſchew the hurt of all trouble from wicked men, with whom the Lord would aſſuredly reckon for moleſting of his People, while they were following their duty to him. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although the Godly may expect the hardeſt uſage in following their duty, that wicked men can deviſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. Yet properly, there can be no harm or evil done unto them, in regard the nature of all afflictions, eſpecially for well-doing, is charged to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. their perſecutors cannot at all reach their better part, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. and all their loſſes by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Truth, are more than ſufficiently made up to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. for, this queſtion may be ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have the force of a denial, <hi>None ſhall be able to harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good.</hi> 2. The beſt way to eſchew, at leaſt to mitigate trouble, even from wicked men, is cloſe adherance to that which is right in the ſight of God: not becauſe wicked men fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the way of well-doing; but becauſe the Lord doth ſometimes allay their fury againſt thoſe that follow it, by putting convictions upon their conſcience of the equity of the cauſe which they perſecute, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17, &amp;c. and doth ſometimes work in their heart ſome reverence toward it, and them that follow it. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. for, here the Apoſtle mentioneth the <hi>following of that which is good,</hi> as the beſt way of eſchewing trouble from wicked men,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105751:79"/>
who would be glad to ſee the miſcarriage of the Godly, that they might thence have occaſion to trouble them: <hi>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> 3. Whoever ſhal enterpriſe to harm, or evil intreat (as the word here ſignifieth) the Children of the Lord for their dutifulneſſe to him, the Lord ſhall enquire after them, he ſhall find them out, and reckon with them, be who they will: for, this queſtion may be taken for the Lord's chalenge of them, and his enquiry for them, to judge them; <hi>Who is he that will harm you?</hi> 4. The Children of the Lord are not only to go about their duty in obedience to his Commands, but likewiſe in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of Chriſt himſelf, as their prime patern, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. and of the reſt of his Saints who have walked in that way before them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. for, this is the deſcription of thoſe to whom this encouragement is given, that they are <hi>followers</hi> (or, as the word is, <hi>imitators) of that which is good.</hi>

                  <p>This Verſe contains ſome further directions to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Chriſtians, for attaining to a right frame of ſpirit, and carriage under their ſufferings. The ſecond, in order, is, That they ſhould reverence and adore in their hearts, the ſoveraignty and holineſſe of God, eſpecially in that diſpenſation of his toward them, in putting them to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, while their wicked perſecutors proſpered; which direction, as alſo the former, is taken out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.12, 13. The third is, That they ſhould timouſly furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch clear knowledge of the Truth, that they may be able to hold forth from the Word of God, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of what they believe and ſuffer for. The fourth is, That their teſtimony for the Truth ſhould be ſeaſoned with meekneſſe, even toward their perſecutors. And the fifth is, That they ſhould entertain in their hearts ſome holy fear of miſcarrying in the way of giving that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is a principal part of a right diſpoſition for ſufferers, to entertain in their hearts the ſenſe and acknowledgment of the holineſſe of God, who though he be matchleſſe in holineſſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. and can have nothing added to that, or any other of his infinit perfections, by any creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35, 36.

The Children of the Lord, while they are under hard uſage from wicked men, are in great hazard not only to forget the ſoveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God over them, to uſe them as he pleaſes for his own glory, which occaſioneth much perturbation of ſpirit in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13. but likewiſe to entertain in their hearts, thoughts unſuitable to the holineſſe and purity of his Nature, as if their ſufferings, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keds proſperity, were not conſiſtent therewith; both which, are imported in this exhortation to acknowledge the holineſſe of God, whom the Apoſtle repreſenteth under ſuch names as hold forth alſo his ſoveraignity, <hi>Sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts.</hi> 3. Although the Godly ought not to be anxious concerning their furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a time of trial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.19.

The Children of the Lord ought not to ſatisfie themſelves with any confidence or perſwaſion concerning the truths of the Goſpel, whereof they have not ſuch clear and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional grounds from the Word, as may not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince themſelves, but ſuch, as they are able to hold forth to others, when they are called; <hi>be ready to give a reaſon to every man that asketh you.</hi> 6. Every teſtimony that God's People give to his Truth before the enemies of it, ought to be ſeaſoned with meekneſſe of ſpirit, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced in their carriage toward their perſecutors by their eſchewing all ſigns of carnal paſſion and revenge againſt them, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.15. by their reſpective and ſober language to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.25. which may be bleſſed of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a mitigation of their trouble, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.1. at leaſt to put convictions upon the wicked of the equity of the cauſe which they perſecute, as the following Verſe clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: for, this is the fourth direction for a right carriage under ſufferings, that they <hi>be ready to give a teſtimony to the Truth with meekneſs.</hi> 7.

                  <p>The fourth motive to preſſe the former directions, and to encourage againſt ſuffering, is, That in their ſuffering for Chriſt, and their duty to Him, they ſhould find much more comfort and ſpiritual advantage, than if they did procure, ſufferings to themſelves by their miſcarriage; And this fourth motive, or encouragement, hath a fifth in the boſom of it, That they ſhould not be put to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuffering, except it were the good will of the Lord ſo to diſpoſe. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſtians have a great deal of more ſpiritual advantage, honour and ſweetneſſe in ſuffering for Chriſt, and duty to Him, than they could have in ſuffering for their faults, though they had obtained mercy for them from the Lord, and had peace in their ſpirits while they did ſtoop to the ſtroak of humane juſtice inflicted for theſe faults; the former ſort of ſufferings being more conform to Chriſt's, and having ordinarily a larger allowance of peace and chearfulneſſe, than uſeth to be letten forth to them who ſuffer for their faults, though they were never ſo ſure of God's mercy: for, in this ſenſe muſt the Apoſtle be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here to compare ſuffering for well doing, and for evil doing, and to prefer the one to the other; becauſe ſuffering from men for evil doing, without obtaining mercy from God, hath no goodneſſe in it at all, and ſo cannot be compared in that with ſuffering for well-doing, as here it is by the Apoſtle; <hi>For, it is better to ſuffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</hi> 2. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this difference, in regard of comfort and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual advantage, which is betwixt ſuffering for well-doing and for evil doing, ſhould move the Lord's People to watchfulneſſe and tender walking, leſt by their

miſcarriage, they deſerve ſuffering at mens hands; and to conſtancy in ſuffering for well doing, conſidering that they have within them ſtrong inclinations to ſuch evils, as being acted, might juſtly put them to ſuffer before men; and that if they ſhift duty to Him, for fear of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from men, He may juſtly leave them to fall in thoſe ſins, which may procure harder ſufferings, with leſſe comfort, than what they ſhould have met with in ſuffering for well doing: for, this is here brought in as a motive to conſtancy in duty, and ſuffering in the way of duty, <hi>that it is better to ſuffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</hi> 3. Suffering for well doing, is a duty that doth not bind, as negative precepts do, at all times, and in all caſes; nor are the Children of the Lord tied to it, as they are to ſome other poſitive duties, for the opportunity whereof they are to watch, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 7. but is only binding when the Lord by his providence, hath brought his People under the power of perſecutors, and they do put them to a neceſſity either of ſuffering, or ſinning: in which caſe only, the Lord manifeſteth his will to his People that they ſhould ſuffer: for, the Apoſtle here commends ſuffering, not abſolutely as other duties, but only upon this ſuppoſition, that it be manifeſted to be the will of God; <hi>For it is better, if the will of God be ſo, that ye ſuffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</hi> 4. When God's will that his People ſhould ſuffer is manifeſted to them, by leaving them no midſt between ſin and ſuffering, then they ought with courage and chearfulneſſe to chooſe ſuffering as the only beſt courſe for them, conſidering that his will is a good will to them, and ſo would have prevented their ſuffering, if it had been good for them; that without His will, no creature could bring them to that neceſſity; and that as it is His will, they ſhould ſuffer for Him, ſo it is His will they ſhould reign with Him: for, this is here caſt in as a ſpecial encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conſtancy in ſuffering for well doing, that they ſhould not be put to undergo that lot, except <hi>the will of God be ſo.</hi>

                  <p>The ſixth motive or encouragement to conſtancy in duty, notwithſtanding of hardeſt ſufferings, is taken from Chriſt's ſufferings for us, whence many encouraging arguments to ſuffer for Him may be drawn. The ſum of all which is, That ſince the innocent Son of God hath compleatly ſatisfied God's juſtice for unworthy ſinners, that He might reconcile them to God, having for that end ſuffered to the very death in his humanity; and that He might apply his purchaſe, is raiſed up again by the power of his Spirit or Godhead; it doth therefore well become his ſinful Followers for whom He died and roſe again, to undergo chearfully a ſuffering lot in following their duty to Him. Hence <hi>Learn.</hi> 1. Of all motives that may prevail with Chriſtians to ſuffer for Chriſt, when they are called, His ſuffering in their room is one of the ſtrongeſt, and ſhould be moſt frequently made uſe of by them for that end, conſidering that He by His ſufferings hath taken the ſting out of all theirs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4. hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated all their enemies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. hath caſt them a ſweet copy to follow concerning the right way of ſuffering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. hath engaged them not to deſire a better lot than He had, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20. and hath made ſure their perſeverance and eternal happineſſe, which none of their troubles can mar, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. for, the Apoſtle, having made uſe of this ſame argument, to this ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in the cloſe of the former Chapter, doth here again inſiſt upon it, as the ſtrongeſt and that which ſhould have moſt weight with all His Redeemed Ones, to move them to ſuffer for Him; <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath ſuffered for ſins.</hi> 2. As the whole time of Chriſt's humiliation was one uninterrupted courſe of ſuffering; So, by that whole courſe, and eſpecially by His offering Himſelf a ſacrifice for us upon the Croſſe, He hath ſo compleated the work
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105751:84"/>
of ſatisfaction to God's juſtice, for the ſins of the Elect, and of purchaſing grace and glory to them, that nothing thereof remaineth to be done, nor needeth that ſacrifice be again repeated: for, though His ſufferings were finite in regard of duration; Yet in regard of the worth, which the excellency of His Perſon who was God, did add to them, they were infinite: for, both in reſpect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of His ſufferings all along His ſtate of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and in regard of the compleatneſſe of them for ſatisfaction to God's juſtice, as alſo in oppoſition to all the legal ſacrifices, which for their imperfection behoved to be often repeated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>He hath once ſuffered for ſins.</hi> 3. Although our bleſſed Mediator had all the ſins of all the Elect upon Him by imputation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and the puniſhment laid upon Him of all the heinous crimes that ever were, or ſhall be committed by the Elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. Yet, was He in Himſelf compleatly juſt and righteous, not only as He is God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.21. but even as Man, He being wholly freed of that original contagion, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. wherewith all others that are come of <hi>Adam</hi> are defiled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. and compleatly conform to the Law of God in heart and practice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. that ſo as our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor He might be lovely to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. and to all the Saints, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.16. for, ſo the Apoſtle ſets Him forth, who ſuffered for ſins, <hi>the Juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> 4. There was nothing in thoſe, for whom Chriſt ſuffered, to have moved Him to lay down his life for them, many of them who were then living, being his actual perſecutors and murderers, and all of them being ſtill at enmity with Him, till He by the vertue of His death changed them, and yet His free love made Him ſuffer for their ſins; <hi>The Juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> 5.

God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. and that being done, to a growing nearneſſe, to wit, of communion and fellowſhip, till they be compleatly one with Him, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.11, 20, 21, &amp;c. for, thus doth the Apoſtle expreſſe the end of Chriſt's death, and His intention in dying, that He might lead us by the hand (as the word here ſignifieth) and give us ready acceſſe to a reconciled God, He hath ſuffered for ſins, the Juſt for the unjuſt, <hi>that He might bring us unto God.</hi> 6. No leſſer degree of ſuffering could be accepted from our Cautioner, than the ſuffering of death, there being no other way, except all had eternally died, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the exact juſtice and righteouſneſſe of God in puniſhing ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. and his faithfulneſſe in executing that juſt threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. to take away the ſting out of the firſt death to His own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. and keep them from taſting of the ſecond, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.51. for which cauſe the Apoſtle here affirms of our Mediator, That He ſuffered, <hi>being put to death.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Although Chriſt did truly humble Himſelf even in reſpect of His Deity, by aſſuming frail fleſh, in a perſonal union therewith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. and obſcuring the glory thereof for a time with the vail of fleſh, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6, 7. Yet (the Godhead being altogether impaſſible) His ſufferings were properly in His humanity, to wit, both in His ſoul, which ſuffered the unſpeakable wrath of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. and in His body, which ſuffered all ſorts of torments whereof it was capable, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. both which parts of humane nature are here comprehended in one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe His ſoul ſuffered only while it was dwelling in fleſh, before His death; <hi>being put to death in the fleſh.</hi> 8. Our Cautioner having paid our debt, could not be holden in the priſon of death, but by the power of His own Spirit, or Godhead, which are eſſentially one, was quickened in His humanity, by the union of His ſoul to His body, and raiſed up, as an evidence that He was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of our debt, and we in Him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. as a pledge that we ſhall be quickened by the vertue of His Reſurrection to newneſſe of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. &amp;c. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

death raiſed to poſſeſs glory with Him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. for, He was <hi>put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit.</hi> 9. All the conſiderations of our ſuffering Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, whereof the Apoſtle doth here mention ſeveral, are ſtrong inducements to His Redeemed People to ſuffer for Him, when He calls them to that honour: for, ſo may every particular here mentioned be applied; that ſince the Son of God being ſo innocent and juſt, did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and by ſuffering did ſo compleatly ſatisfie Juſtice, for ſo miſ-deſerving wretches, and did ſuffer to the very death, for ſo ſweet an end to bring ſinners to God, and had ſo glorious in outgate, It becometh all His Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ones to adventure chearfully upon ſuffering for Him: to which every expreſſion h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

it within time. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The ſecond Perſon of the bleſſed Trinity hath been exerciſing his Mediatory Office, long before his incarnation; and by his Spirit, the third Perſon, ſpeaking through his Servants, hath been publickly inviting ſinners to repentance, and faith in himſelf: for, this preaching to the old world here ſpoken of, muſt be the ſame in ſubſtance with that which is more clearly held forth now under the Goſpel, it being Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. who did then preach by his Spirit, who ſpeaks his mind only, <hi>Job.</hi> 10.13, 14. <hi>By which he went and preached.</hi> 2. When the mind of Chriſt is plainly held forth by the Miniſtery of his Servants, then Chriſt himſelf comes to them to beſtow himſelf, and fellowſhip with him, by his Spirit, upon them that receive his Word; and to deal with others in wrath, as if they had rejected him, immediatly, and in his own Perſon dealing with them: for, though Chriſt did not preach in Perſon to the old world, but only in the Miniſtery of <hi>Noah,</hi> and others of his Servants, Yet, of Him it is here ſaid, that by his Spirit <hi>He went and preached.</hi> 3. It pleaſeth the Lord to invite to repentance, and make offers of his grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many who will never obey his counſel, nor imbrace his offers, that he may make his grace more manifeſt, while he doth more effectually prevail with his own that are among them, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.10. and may take away all excuſe from them that wilfully diſobey his counſels, and reject his offers. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22, for, there are ſpirits, or ſouls, who once had Chriſt preached to them, that are <hi>now in priſon.</hi> 4.

Of all the ſins that men and women commit, who have the way of ſalvation truly preached to them, this is of the higheſt nature, and the chief cauſe of their damnation, that they will not be perſwaded to accept the offers of God's grace and mercy in Chriſt, will not obey the ſweet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of his Word, will not follow the motions and ſtrivings of his Spirit with them thereby; in which courſe whoſoever do continue, they look like thoſe that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the <hi>priſon of Hell:</hi> for it is clear by comparing this Text with <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. that theſe, here ſpoken of, had offers of forgiveneſſe of ſin, and eternal life through the Meſſiah, invitations to repentance and holy walking, and ſome motions of his Spirit working with his Words and yet, though they were guilty of many groſſe and filthy ſins, as appeareth by the ſixth and ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> their diſobedience to the Goſpel, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to be perſwaded thereby (as the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth) is here ſet down as the chief cauſe of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual impriſonment in Hell; thoſe <hi>ſpirits are in priſon, who ſometimes were diſobedient.</hi> 7.

torment and vexation, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. for, here the Spirit of the Lord, ſpeaking by this Apoſtle, declareth to the world, that he is mindful of the deſpiſing of his patience and pains, manifeſted many thouſand years ago, toward them that are now in Hell; <hi>Once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah, &amp;c.</hi> 9. Even thoſe who may have good hope through grace, that they are delivered from the pit of deſtruction, ought to conſider the woful caſe of them that are there, as a mean to keep them from provoking the Lord by thoſe ſins, which bring ſouls to that priſon; and as a motive unto thankfulneſſe to Jeſus Chriſt, and conſtancy in duty to him, notwithſtanding of temporary ſufferings, who hath delivered them from the ſame: for, here the caſe of the damned for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpel, is preſented by the Apoſtle to the conſideration of thoſe, who, (as he ſuppoſeth in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words) might comfort themſelves in their exemption from wrath by Chriſt's ſufferings, as an argument to conſtancy in holineſſe, notwithſtanding of hardeſt uſage from men; which is the Apoſtle's ſcope to preſſe. 10. When the Lord vouchſafes to ſend his Word unto a People, he uſeth alſo with it to frame his workings and diſpenſations, ſo as may be moſt fitting for bearing-in his Word upon them, that if they reject and ſlight both, their ſtripes may be double: for, beſide that Chriſt went and preached to the old world, he made a work to be wrought before their eyes, which was a viſible preaching of wrath to come upon them, except they did repent, and a real invitation of them to repentance, that they ſeeing ſuch a ſmall veſſel, in compariſon of the great multitude that were upon the face of the earth, every one might have ſtudied to be one of thoſe who might have had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into it; <hi>He went and preached, and his long-ſuffering waited while the Ark was a preparing.</hi> 11. Whenſoever the Lord hath judgments to bring upon the generality of a People, it is his way to provide ſufficient means of ſafety for his own that are among them; ſometimes, from the outward judgment, as here, and alwayes from
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105751:87"/>
the evil of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10. for, while judgment was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching upon the old world, <hi>the Ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is eight ſouls, were ſaved.</hi> 12. Though there never were, nor will be at any time wanting, ſome true Believers in Jeſus Chriſt, in regard of his ſtanding relation of a Husband and Head to the Church; Yet, ſo far may profanity, or error, overſpread the face of the Church, that the number of viſible Profeſſors may be very few; and therefore the multitude of ſuch can be no real mark of the true Church: for, here in all the world there are but a few (and of thoſe, a great part wicked, for what may be gathered from the Scripture hiſtory) <hi>that is eight ſouls, ſaved by water.</hi> 13. It may fare the better with the wicked in this life (though nothing in that which is to come) that they have been in ſociety with the Godly, and have outward relations to them partly, for the more ſatisfaction and encouragement of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who are tied to them by natural bonds, or affection; and partly, that they may be ſome way ſerviceable to the Godly in the Work of the Lord; for which cauſes, among others, there are here <hi>eight ſouls</hi> (whereof ſome were of a wicked diſpoſition, and curſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.22, 25.) <hi>ſaved by water.</hi> 14. The Lord can make that which is the mean of deſtruction to the wicked, a mean of ſafety to his own: for, the water which drowned the reſt of the world, beareth up the Ark; and ſo proveth a mean of the ſafety of there eight, <hi>who were ſaved by water.</hi>

                  <p>The eight encouragement to conſtancy in ſuffering for Chriſt, and his Truth, is, That ſince Believers have a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual priviledge anſwerable to the Ark, ſealing their ſafety from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ludge of God's wrath, to wit, their Baptiſm; not the external part of it alone, which can only remove
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105751:88"/>
the filth of the body, But the internal, to wit, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſts bloud to the conſcience of Believers, which the Apoſtle expreſſeth here by the effect thereof, that thereby Believers may challenge all Chriſt's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe as theirs, and anſwer all challenges to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and that upon this ground, that their Cautioner is abſolved from their Debt, whereof his Reſurrection is the evidence: Therefore they have no reaſon to faint in following their duty, or fear to be loſt in the midſt of their ſufferings. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Whatever outward priviledge any of the Lord's People had of old, when he was working in a more extraordinary way than now, every ordinary Believer may find in Jeſus Chriſt a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual privileage anſwerable to it: Faith can ſeed upon Chriſt the bread from Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.32, 35. as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> did upon the Manna; it can draw ſpiritual life and health from him, as the ſtung <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had health to their bodies by looking to the brazen Serpent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15, 16. and can find ſpiritual and eternal ſafety in Him through his own means, as in an Ark, when others are periſhing in the deludge of his wrath: for, though Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the Apoſtle's time, had not ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of preſervation from perſecution, as <hi>Noah</hi> and the few with him had from the flood, Yet, they have a ſpiritual priviledge anſwerable to it, and of a far better nature; <hi>The like figure whereunto Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us.</hi> 2. Baptiſm doth in a ſpiritual ſenſe reſemble the Ark, in ſo far as few in compariſon of the reſt of the world, do partake even of that outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as few were in the Ark, In that it is equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to good and bad, who are within the viſible Church; as but ſuch were admitted into the Ark, In that it doth exempt all that partake of it according to Chriſt's appointment, from the common caſe of the reſt of the world, and doth ſeal to the Elect, ſafety from that wrath which doth deſtroy the greateſt part of the world: in which, and the like reſpects, it is here compared with the Ark; <hi>The like figure whereunto Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us.</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:105751:88"/>
3. Although the ſpiritual and eternal ſalvation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, be only the effect of the merit of Chriſt's bloud applied to the conſcience; Yet, doth the Spirit of Chriſt in Scripture oftentimes aſcribe the ſame to the inſtrument or mean by which He doth convey that ſalvation to them, (compare with this place, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.50. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.) that ſo he may keep up due reſpect to his own means, which, if they be neglected or deſpiſed by them that have the opportunity of them, ſalvation cannot be expected: Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Baptiſm doth now ſave us.</hi> 4. There is no ſmall hazard of peoples placing too much in the external and outward part of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as if that of it ſelf were of ſome efficacy for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; againſt which the Miniſters of Chriſt have no leſſe need to guard in their Doctrine, than againſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples under valuing of the Ordinance: for, after that the Apoſtle hath aſſerted Baptiſm, to be the mean of our ſalvation, anſwerable to the Ark, leſt any might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves of ſalvation, becauſe they had received the external Baptiſm, he addeth, as a guard, <hi>not the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of the filth of the fleſh.</hi> 5. The internal Baptiſm, to wit, the application of Chriſt's merits, is known to be beſtowed upon ſinners, by the effects thereof upon their conſcience: which do appear, firſt, When they do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Lord's offers and commands in the Goſpel, by their hearty acceptation of the one, and engagement in his ſtrength to obey the other. Secondly, When they become humbly familiar with God, in laying claim to the purchaſe of Chriſt's death, as theirs. And, thirdly, When they are taught of Him, to anſwer the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and challenges that may be brought againſt them in doing of the former two: for, all there three which make a good conſcience, to wit, <hi>ſtipulation</hi> or engagement, <hi>claim</hi> or challenge, and <hi>apologie</hi> or anſwer, are in the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this word, which the Apoſtle makes uſe of here to expreſſe the internal part of Baptiſm, to wit, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt's merits by the effect thereof, which effect manifeſteth the cauſe, even <hi>the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>

                  <p>The laſt encouragement to Chriſtians under all their ſufferings, hath three branches.

And, thirdly, Since He hath all the heavenly hoſts of Angels at his command, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of his Followers need to fear ſuffering in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their duty to Him. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt's withdrawing of his bodily preſence from his People at his Aſcenſion, is ſo far from being matter of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, as the Diſciples did miſtake it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.5, 6. that by the contrary it is to them a well-ſpring of much conſolation, whence they may with joy draw an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to every diſcouragement, He being gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that He may pour out of his Spirit more plentifully than He did before His Aſcenſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. and having in that very act of His Aſcenſion triumphed

The high eſteem and power which Chriſt, as our Mediator, hath with the Father, ſignified by his ſitting at his right hand, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having the fulneſſe of grace and glory given Him to diſpenſe to his Redeemed Ones, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. is another ſtrong ground of Believers conſolation, whence alſo they have the anſwer of a good conſcience to all challenges given-in againſt them; His ſitting there, being a clear evidence to them, that the work of their Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is compleatly done, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11, 12. that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is abundantly ſatisfied therewith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. for, this is another branch of their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That <hi>Chriſt is on the right hand of God.</hi> 3. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the order, or ſeveral degrees that are among the Angels in Heaven, in which we are not curiouſly to enquire, ſeing it is not made known in Scripture; Yet this is ſure, That Jeſus Chriſt, not only as He is God; but as He is our Mediator, hath all of them ſubject to Him, as His Meſſengers and mighty Hoſts, having authority from Him, for the defence and comfort of the Godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. and for the terror and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His and their enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.16, 17. for, of Him, as our Mediator, is this ſpoken, that He hath <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Authorities, and Powers ſubject unto Him.</hi> 4. The conſideration of this ſubjection of all the Angels and heavenly Hoſts to Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, may be very comfortable to the few oppreſt Godly, Eſpecially when the Powers and Authorities on Eearth, and their Meſſengers and Hoſts are imployed againſt them, as in this Apoſtle's time they were: for, this is here given to Believers, as the laſt branch of their encouragement in this Chapter, That they ſerve, and ſuffer for ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as hath <hi>Angels, and Authorities, and Powers ſubject unto Him.</hi>

               <p>IN this Chapter, (which containeth an enlargement of the former purpoſe) the Apoſtle doth, by ſeveral arguments, preſſe upon the Redeemed, the ſtudy of holineſſe; and giveth them many encouragements againſt ſuffering in that way, which are the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts of the Chapter. The ſum of the firſt is, That Believers ſhould renounce the ſlavery of their ſins, firſt, Becauſe they were eſteemed judicially to have ſuffered for ſin in their Cautioner, Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. Secondly, Becauſe they had already followed too long the filthy faſhions of the profane, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Becauſe thoſe who did wonder at, and ſlander them for changing their courſe and company, behoved to give a ſad accompt thereof to their Judge, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. Fourthly, Becauſe cenſure, and oppoſition from the profane had been the lot of the Saints departed, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. And, fifthly, Becauſe time was now near an end, Therefore they ſhould keep themſelves in a praying diſpoſition, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of love, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and of hoſpitality toward the Saints, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and imploy their talents and gifts in their ſeveral places, for the glory of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11.</p>
               <p>The ſum of the ſecond part, is, That hardeſt ſufferings ſhould not ſeem ſtrange to Believers: conſidering, firſt, that they were ſent to try their graces, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Secondly, that by them they were made conform to their Maſter. And, thirdly, ſhould ſhare of his glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that even reproach for faithfulneſſe to Chriſt, ſhould prove them happy. Fifthly, that they ſhould be ſure of the preſence of His Spirit with them. Sixthly, that He did reſent their wrongs as done againſt Himſelf. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, that He did eſteem Himſelf glorified by their ſufferings, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. providing they did not procure theſe ſufferings by their miſcarriage, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. but endured them with courage and chearfulneſſe for the Truth of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Eightly, that God's appointed time was now

come for purging of his Church by ſuch hot perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that even the Godly could not come to Heaven but with great difficulty.

his death, for weakening the love of ſin in their hearts: the ſtrength and vigor whereof is the main thing that makes Chriſtians ſhift a croſſe for Chriſt, and indiſpoſes them for carrying it aright, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. for, the Apoſtle, having taught Believers, in the laſt part of the former Chapter, to make uſe of Chriſt's ſufferings for them, as a motive and encouragement to ſuffer for Him, he doth here teach them to make a further uſe of His ſufferings, as neceſſary to be joyned with the former, if ſo be they would attain unto it, to wit, that by faith they ſhould draw vertue from his ſufferings for mortification of their corruptions; <hi>Foraſmuch then as Chriſt hath ſuffered, arm your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Chriſt our Mediator hath taken true fleſh upon Him, and in it hath ſuffered all that wrath which was due to the Elect for their ſins; So that His ſufferings were not to be a patern only to Chriſtians, of a right way of ſuffering, but they were in the room and place of the Elect, as is clearly imported in this ground which the Apoſtle layeth down in the beginning of this Chapter, from whence he is to infer and preſſe upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers the ſtudy of mortification; <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh.</hi> 3. As thoſe for whom Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the fleſh, and who cannot therefore be overcome by their ſpiritual enemies, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. muſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, make them for a battel and a fighting-life with thoſe enemies; So, they are of themſelves naked, and without armor for this ſpiritual warfare, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame from Jeſus Chriſt; and not only ſo, but they are often found ſecure, and forgetful of their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and therefore have need to be rouſed up to lay hold upon their ſpiritual armor, and to accept of the ſame from Jeſus Chriſt, as is imported in this military exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Arm your ſelves.</hi> 4. The Believer's beſt armor againſt his ſpiritual enemies, eſpecially temptations to ſin, is the believing conſideration of Chriſt's ſuffering, in his name and nature, which cannot but give him cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſtrength in the battel, ſeing by theſe ſufferings of Chriſt for him, his ſpiritual enemies are ſpoiled of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105751:91"/>
all power of overcoming, though not of moleſting; and ſo he may be ſure of victory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56, 57. for, with this ſame very conſideration, or notion (as the word ſignifieth) that Chriſt hath ſuffered in our room and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Apoſtle exhorteth Believers to arm themſelves againſt all temptations; <hi>Foraſmuch then as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh, arm your ſelves alſo with the ſame mind.</hi> 5. What-ever ſufferings were inflicted upon Chriſt, the ſame are judicially reckoned to be inflicted upon Believers in Him, He being their Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. and a common perſon repreſenting them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19. for, the Apoſtle, having in the firſt part of the verſe, aſſerted Chriſt's ſufferings for Believers, in the cloſe of it, he deſigns the Believer as if he had ſuffered in his own perſon; <hi>He that hath ſuffered in the fleſh.</hi> 6. None that do truly believe their union with, and intereſt in ſuffering, Chriſt Jeſus, can continue in the ſlavery and ſervitude of ſin, they being, by their believing of their union with Him who ſuffered for them, certified of the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. and ſo encouraged in the battel againſt it; and by His love, manifeſted in his ſuffering, powerfully conſtrained never to take pleaſure in that which put Him to ſo much pain, and doth ſo much grieve his holy Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

more of their time in this mortal ſtate ſhould be ſpent in the ſervice of thoſe luſts, whereunto corrupt nature lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth unregenerate men; but that their life and time ſhould be wholly ſpent in conforming themſelves to the will of God, who gave Chriſt to ſuffer for them: whereby it appears that the <hi>ceaſing from ſin,</hi> ſpoken of in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Verſe, muſt be underſtood of the Believers obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtudy of mortification of it, and of Chriſt's undertaking to make him ceaſe from it, as the original word there uſed, ſignifieth. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Whoever believes that Chriſt hath ſuffered for them, ſhould think themſelves thereby obliged, not to give the leaſt part of their life or time in the fleſh to the ſervice of their luſts, or to take the leaſt part thereof from obedience to the will of God, but to imploy the ſame intirely and wholly in the mortifying of ſin, wherein they ſhould have no more pleaſure than if they were dead men; and in conforming themſelves to the will of God in doing and ſuffering, which ſhould be the great buſineſſe of their life, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that their time is ſhort, and their ſtrength, while they are in frail fleſh, but ſmall, which is here inſinuated as a reaſon of this truth: for, this the Apoſtle makes the end of the Believers union with ſuffering-Chriſt, and the uſe that he ſhould make of this priviledge, that Chriſt hath ſuffered for him, and that he is eſteemed to have ſuffered in Chriſt, to wit, that <hi>be no longer ſhould live the reſt of his time in the fleſh, to the luſts of men, but to the will of God.</hi> 2. Chriſtians cannot but be ſlaves to their own unmortified corruptions, and ſervants to the luſts one of another, making it their very trade of life ſo to do, until they do by faith arm themſelves with the conſideration of Chriſt's undertaking to deliver them from that ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and of his purchaſing vertue by his death for that effect: for, while the Apoſtle exhorteth them thus to arm themſelves, that they might no longer live to the luſts of men, he doth clearly import, that before their ſo doing, they had been ſlaves; and until they did ſo, they could not but <hi>live the reſt of their time in the fleſh, to the

                  <p>The ſecond argument, whereby the Apoſtle preſſeth upon Believers the ſtudy of holineſſe, eſpecially that part of it which conſiſts in the mortifying of ſin, is, That they had given too much of their time already to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their luſts, wallowing themſelves in all ſorts of vileneſſe, againſt both Tables of the Law, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Heathens, among whom they were ſcattered: whereof the Apoſtle giveth here ſome inſtances.

The third, fourth, and fifth, point out their exceſſe in drinking and belly chear, with their ſhameleſſe and unſeemly carriage, while they keeped up a ſinful ſociety together. And the laſt is, their idolatry or falſe-worſhip, in a ſpecial way deteſtable to God. In all which ſteps, and others of that kind, they having too long walked already, they ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105751:93"/>
now to think it more than time to break off that courſe, and to conſecrate the remnant of their time to the ſtudy of holineſſe, for His honour, whom they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo much diſhonoured. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord makes a gracious change upon the hearts of ſinners, they will be ſo far from putting off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the forſaking of their ſins till afterward, that they will with grief look back upon the time they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given way to them, as very long, and too long to have been imployed that way: ſo, that they who mind to live any longer in the courſe of their ſins, have no ground to think that they have yet met with the power of converting grace, ſeing they ſay in ſubſtance that they have not yet taken time enough to diſhonour God, and deſtroy their own ſoul: for, this is the ſad language of every real Convert; <hi>The time paſt of our life may ſuffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles.</hi> 2. The longer that ſinners have continued in the courſe of their ſins, and the greater height of wickedneſſe they have been at before their converſion, the more eagerly ſhould they ſet about the mortifying of ſin, and the more aſſiduous and ſerious ſhould they be in the ſtudy of holineſſe after their converſion, that ſo they may ſo far as they can, reſtore the Lord to his honour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9, 10. reclaim, if it be poſſible, ſome of thoſe whom formerly they have hardened in their ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.11. and get their own hearts looſed from the love of thoſe ſins, which long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and cuſtom have deeply rooted in them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. for, the Apoſtle makes this a reaſon why Believers ſhould give no part of their life, or time, to the ſervice of their luſts, but imploy the ſame wholly in obedience to the Lord, that they had ſpent ſo much thereof in the ſlavery of ſin already, and had been at ſo great a height in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; <hi>For the time paſt of our life may ſuffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs, luſts, &amp;c.</hi> 3.

love to be moſt free, by beſtowing it upon them, who have nothing in them but what is loathſom in his ſight, and moſt powerful in coming over, and doing away ſo much vileneſſe, and adorning the ſoul where it was with his beautiful grace: for, the Apoſtle clearly ſuppoſeth here himſelf and other Converts, for whom Chriſt had ſuffered in the fleſh, to have been really ſuch as are here deſcribed, <hi>working the will of the Gentiles, walking in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs, luſts, exceſſe of wine, &amp;c.</hi> 4. It doth much concern all true Converts, to entertain in their hearts the lively apprehenſion of the ſeveral ſteps of their former vileneſſe, wherein they have wallowed themſelves before their converſion, that they may be ſtill vile in their own eyes, conſidering how diſhonourable to God they have ſometimes been, and may have their hearts frequently raiſed in the praiſes of Him who hath graciouſly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and powerfully changed them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may manifeſt much compaſſion and meekneſſe in their carriage toward thoſe who yet remain in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein themſelves once were, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.2, 3. for, here the Apoſtle repreſenteth to his own heart, and the hearts of other Converts, the ſeveral branches of that profane diſpoſition and courſe wherein they had lived before their converſion, to wit, that they had <hi>wrought the will of the Gentiles, walked in laſciviouſneſs, luſts, exceſſe of wine, &amp;c.</hi> 5. True penitents will not ſtand to proclaim and aggreage their own vileneſſe, when it may ſerve for the glory of Chriſt's free grace, in pardoning and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and may provoke others to mortification and holineſſe: for, here the Apoſtle puts himſelf in the catalogue of theſe, who had walked in <hi>laſciviouſneſſe, luſts, exceſſe of wine, &amp;c.</hi> 6. They who would reflect aright upon their diſpoſition and carriage before their converſion, ſhould not only make their more groſſe practices, but the very inward motions and luſts of their hearts toward thoſe ſins which poſſibly they have never committed, and conſider with what ſtrong benſell of ſpirit they have been inclined to, or did commit, thoſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105751:94"/>
iniquities, and call to mind the ſeveral ſorts of their ſins againſt both Tables of the Law, ſuch as, their abuſing of God's good creatures to be fewel to their luſts, their following the example of others, their ſerving of others, or hardening of them in their ſins by evil example, their forſaking, or corrupting of the right Worſhip of God, and the like: that by the diſtinct and clear up-taking of all, they may be the more humble, and the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to praiſe God, and to be diligent in their duty: for, ſuch a repreſentation is here given to Converts, of their former diſpoſition and carriage, that they had in time paſt <hi>wrought</hi> (with great intention and benſel of ſpirit, as the word ſignifieth) <hi>the will of the Gentiles</hi> (by following their examples, ſerving and encouraging them in their ſins) <hi>walking in</hi> outward <hi>vileneſs,</hi> and inward <hi>luſts,</hi> in <hi>exceſſe of wine,</hi> and ſuch other groſſe ſins againſt the ſecond Table; and in <hi>abominable idolatries,</hi> againſt the firſt Table. 7. Where the love of ſin is entertained in the heart, and profanity given way to, in the practice, contrary to the ſecond Table, there is ordinarily joyned therewith, a forſaking or corrupting of the right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, contrary to the firſt; A ſpirit of ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion in the matters of Religion and God's Worſhip, being the ordinary and juſt plague of God, upon thoſe who frame not their heart and manners according to the Rule of the Word, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. for, this is the laſt inſtance of their profane courſe, and may be taken for the conſequent of the reſt, that having <hi>walked in luſts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of wine, &amp;c.</hi> they did alſo <hi>walk in abominable idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> 8.

The ſum whereof is, That however they who had now changed their courſe and company might expect to be made a wonder to the profane, and diſgraced by them ſo far as they could, for not joyning with them in their profane courſes formerly deſcribed; Yet this ought to be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Godly in the way of holineſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that theſe their mockers and perſecutors behoved ſhortly to give a ſtrict and ſad account of their way to the Judge of all. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Men that are left of God to live in any ſinful courſe, are very unwilling that any ſhould part company with them in their way, and are ſtrongly deſirous to have others infected with their ſins, that ſo there might be none to make them aſhamed, and many to encourage them in their evil way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.5. for, ſo much is imported in this, that <hi>they think ſtrange that others run not with them to the ſame exceſſe of riot.</hi> 2. Were the courſe of profane men never ſo vile, and even ſuch as Nature's light cannot but condemn; yet it is to them matter of great admiration that any ſhould aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the courſe which they follow, becauſe they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a paradiſe in the ſatisfaction of their luſts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. and the true ſweetneſſe which is in Chriſt's ſervice is wholly hid from them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. Therefore <hi>they think it ſtrange that others run not with them to the ſame exceſſe of riot.</hi> 3. It doth not ſatisfie graceleſſe perſons to go at leiſure in the way to their own deſtruction, but being acted by that violent ſpirit of Satan, they make all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105751:95"/>
the haſt they can toward their own ruine, as men in a race do for a great prize, as the word here ſignifies; and will not ſpare to ſpend their bodies and ſpirits, and waſt their means in the ſervice of their luſts, and cannot be ſatisfied with any that will not do the like, as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the ſignification of theſe words, <hi>They think i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſtrange that ye run not with them to the ſame exceſſe of riot.</hi> 4. Profane men cannot abide that the Godly ſhould be in credit and reputation beſide them, partly, becauſe of their natural enmity againſt them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe their way is a ſhame and reproof to theirs, as Chriſt's was to his enemies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.7. therfore they deviſe and ſpread falſe calumnies, to hurt the credit (as the word here ſignifies) of the Godly; <hi>ſpeaking evil of you.</hi> 5. Even the Godly are ſo little mortified to their credit before the world, and do ſo little prize eſteem with God, and his People, that the mockery and ſlanders even of profane men, are ready to prove great diſcouragement to them in the wayes of the Lord: for, the Spirit of God finds it neceſſary here, to guard againſt this diſcouragement, by diſcovering of it, and threatning the ſlanderers; <hi>They think ſtrange that ye run not with them, &amp;c. ſpeaking evil of you: who ſhall give account, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Although the ſaving grace of Chriſt doth not looſe thoſe, upon whom it is vouchſafed, from the relations they may have to grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſons, nor from the duties of thoſe relations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet from fellowſhip with them in neceſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duties, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10. and 7.12, 13. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, &amp;c. Yet it will make them ſeparate from their ſinfull faſhions, and loath their company in their ſinful courſes, even though they ſhould be wondred at and evil ſpoken of for ſo doing: for, the Apoſtle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth clearly, that thoſe Converts, to whom he ſpeaks, would not now keep fellowſhip with their former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in their ſinfull courſes, what-ever they might ſuffer at their hands, while he ſaith, <hi>They think it ſtrange that ye run not with them to the ſame exceſſe of riot.</hi> 7. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a long-ſuffering God may let wicked men have
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105751:95"/>
a long time of proſpering in their ſinful wayes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of his beloved People; yea, and may defer his reckoning with them the whole length of their time, Yet, of neceſſity, they muſt all of them at laſt appear before Him as their Judge, at the great day, when both thoſe of them that have died before that time, and ſuch as ſhall then be found living, muſt be preſent, to <hi>give account to Him, that judgeth quick and dead.</hi> 8. The delay of the laſt reckoning with wicked men, is not, becauſe the Lord is not ready for that work, but, becauſe there is yet a number of the Elect to be gathered, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.11. their faith and patience is to be tried, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.12. and the wicked to be more ripened for judgment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 15. So that there is nothing upon the Lord's part that hindereth the day of account; for, He is <hi>ready to judge the quick and the dead.</hi> 9. So dear are the Lord's People to Him, and ſo exact is He in his juſtice, that there is not a thought in wicked mens hearts, nor a word in their mouthes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Him, or his People, but He takes notice of it, and will exact a ſtrict account thereof from them: for, here the Spirit of God, ſignifieth His notice-taking of their admiring thoughts of the Godly, and their ill ſpeeches of them, and aſſureth His own, that for theſe they ſhall <hi>give account to Him, who is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</hi> 10. Although the Children of the Lord ſhould not deſire a wofull day upon the moſt wicked for any perſonal injury, they have received from them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.16. nor rejoyce when it comes upon them, becauſe they are their enemies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.17. but rather ſhould pray for their converſion and ſalvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. Yet, it is both lawful and neceſſary for the Lord's ſuffering People to conſider how glorious the Lord will be in his juſtice upon ſo many of them as are irrecoverable, and without the compaſſe of his electing love; and thereby ought to comfort their hearts againſt their bitter flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and other injuries of that kind: for, this is here given as an encouraging motive to the ſtudy of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, notwithſtanding of any diſcouragement from ſuch,

that they ſhall <hi>give account to Him, that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth argument to conſtancy in holineſſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of any diſcouragement from the profane world, is, That ſeing the Goſpel had been preached to the Saints who are now at their reſt, for this very end, that they being exerciſed in their external condition with the hard cenſures and perſecution of the profane, might have the life of grace promoted in their hearts, and ſo be fitted for life eternal; there was therefore no reaſon why the Lord's People ſhould be diſcouraged in that way, becauſe of ſuch a lot as all the Saints departed had met with. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. All that believe the Goſpel, and give up themſelves to the obedience of it, may reſolve to have many hard cenſures paſt upon them by thoſe that do not profit by it, to be judged by them, a deceived and accurſed people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.47, 49. a proud and preciſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who will not do as neighbour and others do, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.2, 5. to have many falſe calumnies raiſed and ſpread of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. and to be condemned to the worſt uſage that wicked men can bring upon them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.6. for, this is here ſet down as the lot of the Saints departed, and the conſequent of their imbracing the Goſpel, <hi>For, for this cauſe the Gospel was preached to them that are dead, that they may be judged according to men in the fleſh.</hi> 2. Although the Goſpel of it ſelf tend to the making of peace both with God, and amongſt thoſe that hear it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. and the Lord doth no wayes approve pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane mens cenſuring, or condemning them that imbrace it, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.6. Yet doth the Lord ſend the Goſpel among men for this very end, that upon occaſion of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples imbracing of it, wicked men may vent their natural enmity againſt Him, by their perſecuting of His People,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:105751:96"/>
that ſo they may be juſtly puniſhed for that and other of their ſins, and His own People may be exerciſed by their oppoſition, for their good; which are juſt and holy ends upon God's part; <hi>For, for this cauſe was the Goſpel preached to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men, &amp;c.</hi> 3. It giveth much encouragement to the Lords People in the way of their duty againſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements from the profane, to conſider, firſt, That they are not ſingular in a ſuffering lot, ſeing the ſame hath fallen to the Saints before, in whoſe perſon God hath given a proof of His power and good-will to bear His own through all their trials. Secondly, That their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from wicked men, can reach no further than their fleſh, or outward man, and the concernments thereof. Thirdly, That thoſe troubles can continue no longer than their dwelling in the fleſh. And, fourthly, That all their hard exerciſes are carved out not by the luſts of men, but by the holy and wiſe providence of God: for, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are here preſented to the Godly for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement againſt the mockery and perſecution of the profane, that the ſame had been the lot of the Saints now departed, that it was meaſured out by the Lord, that it could only reach their fleſh, and them only while they were in frail fleſh, as is imported in theſe words; <hi>For, for this cauſe was the Goſpel preached to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the fleſh.</hi> 4. Gods great end in ſending and keeping up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel among His own, is, That they being quickened by His Spirit, which He communicates to them through the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. may be enabled to live the life of faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. and holineſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and may have alſo a life of conſolation here, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. and a life of glory hereafter, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. All which is imported in this great end of preaching of the Goſpel to the Lords People, <hi>That they might live according to God in the ſpirit.</hi> 5. The life of grace and of conſolation, could not thrive ſo well in the hearts of the Godly, not could they be fitted for the life of glory, except they met
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105751:97"/>
with trials, and oppoſition from the wicked of the world, to ſtir them up to the exerciſe of their grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. and to cry for a further meaſure of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.25. to looſe their hearts from this life, and make them long for a better, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. <hi>For, for this cauſe the Goſpel was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the Saints departed, that they might be judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to men in the fleſh, but</hi> (by the bleſſing of God upon the Goſpel, and upon their hard exerciſe from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) <hi>might live according to God in the ſpirit.</hi>

                  <p>The fifth argument to the ſtudy of holineſſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of diſcouragements in the way thereof, is, That wicked mens oppoſition, and the Godlies ſufferings, and all things of that nature would ſhortly be at an end: from which, together with the former arguments, the Apoſtle inferreth ſeven directions for attaining to a right carriage in duty, under ſo much oppoſition from wicked men, whereof three are comprehended in this Verſe; The firſt is, That they ſhould manifeſt moderation and prudence in their diſpoſition and carriage. The ſecond is, That they ſhould be much with God in prayer. The third is, That they ſhould carefully watch againſt every thing that might mar their intercourſe with God in that duty, Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It cannot now be long to the end of time, and all things in it whether we compare the remainder of time, with that which is already paſt, or the whole of it, with eternity; or whether we conſider how near the end of time, and all things in it, is to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon: in all which reſpects, the Apoſtle expreſly aſſerts here, that <hi>the end of all things is at hand.</hi> 2.

                  <p>The fourth direction to the Lord's People for attaining to a right carriage under ſo much oppoſition from the profane, which the Apoſtle inferreth from the former arguments to the ſtudy of holineſſe, eſpecially that, taken from Chriſt's love to His own, manifeſted in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is, That they would labour for fervency of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one towards another; and this the Apoſtle preſſeth with great earneſtneſſe, as the ſum and chief of all the duties we owe to our neighbour; and bears it in by this argument, That love will prevent and paſſe many mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wrongs, which cannot but mar comfortable ſociety among the Lord's People. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Next unto our love to the Lord Jeſus, which is the firſt and great Command in the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.38. Love to His People ought to be ſtudied above all other things, it being the main evidence of our love to Him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. and of His love to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. and that which makes way for every other duty to our neighbour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. for, the Apoſtle ſuppoſing love to Chriſt, to be in the hearts of thoſe to whom he writes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.8. doth preſſe this love to others of His People in the next room, as that which ſhould have the precedency of any other duty; <hi>Above all things have fervent charity among your ſelves.</hi> 2. They that love Chriſt, ſhould not only entertain love in their own hearts to others of His People, what-ever their eſtate or condition be, but ſhould likewiſe labour to procure and cheriſh hearty love in and among all the reſt of God's People: for, this direction, as it preſſeth upon every one of the Lord's People, love towards one another, ſo it preſſeth upon every one of them the entertaining and promoting of mutual love among others; <hi>Have fervent charity among your ſelves.</hi> 3. The more hatred and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the Children of the Lord meet with from the profane world, the more warmneſſe of affection ſhould
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:105751:98"/>
they entertain and expreſſe towards one another, that ſo the comfort they have in one anothers affection, may make up to them the diſcouragement they have from their wicked enemies: for, while this People were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to many diſcouragements from the profane, as is clear from the former words, the Apoſtle with great earneſtneſſe, preſſeth them to this, as that which would ſweeten their ſad lot; <hi>Above all things have fervent charity among your ſelves.</hi> 4. It is not enough that the Lord's People keep themſelves free of malice and hatred one of another; neither yet, that they have ſuch a meaſure of affection toward one another, as they ought to have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all men, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. Yea, even their very enemies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. but they muſt beware of all cold-rifeneſſe of affection one toward another, and labour for ſuch a hight of love as may keep them alwayes in a benſel to do one another good, and ſuch as may not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the failings one of another: for, ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of affection is here preſſed by the Apoſtle in theſe words, wherein there is a metaphor from a Bow that is bended; <hi>Have fervent charity among your ſelves.</hi> 5. None of the Children of the Lord have ground to expect ſuch a ſociety of His People to converſe with in this life, in whom they may not diſcern many failings and wrongs, and thoſe often reiterated both againſt God, and againſt one another, which cannot but mar the benefit and comfort of their ſociety, unleſſe one of them can pardon and paſſe-by a multitude of ſuch in others: for, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument doth import, that there will be among the Saints, <hi>a multitude of ſins to be covered.</hi> 6. Although the Lord's People ought not to juſtifie or connive at the faults one of another, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. but with zeal and meekneſſe to point them out to them, and reprove them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. which ſhould be much deſired, and well taken by one of them from another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5. Yet, where true love is, it will not be interrupted by the diſcerning of theſe, but will cover them, by pardoning the wrong done to the perſon that hath love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. interceding with God
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:105751:99"/>
for pardon of the wrong done againſt Him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. hiding from the party injuring, our knowledge of ſuch wrongs, as we may in charity think they will challenge themſelves for, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.23. and all of them, ſo far as may be, from the profane, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.13. who can make no better uſe of their knowledge of them, than to take occaſion from them to loath and diſgrace Religion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. and eſpecially by furthering the repentance of the guilty perſon, and their uſe-making of the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.20. whereby alone ſin is covered from God's juſtice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. for, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of ſin, here ſpoken of, is not attributed to love, as if it could either juſtifie our ſelves, or others, But becauſe it is a grace that pardoneth and hideth wrongs done againſt them that have it, and furthereth others what it can to ſeek the Lord's forgiving of theſe wrongs alſo; <hi>Love covereth a multitude of ſins.</hi> 7. The conſideration of the many wrongs and ſinful infirmities that one of the Lord's People may diſcern in another, ſhould be ſo far from weakening the affections of one of them toward another, and ſo marring their comfortable ſociety, that by the contrary it ſhould move them to ſtudy the greater fervency of affection, that thereby they may cover theſe infirmities, and by their ſo doing be the liker to their Lord, whoſe love kythes in covering a multitude of ſins, in every one of His own, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. for, it is here brought in as a reaſon encouraging to the ſtudy of fervent chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that thereby they ſhould <hi>cover a multitude of ſins.</hi>

Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It may be the lot of the Lord's dear People, to
<pb facs="tcp:105751:99"/>
be without houſe or harbour, or any ſuch worldly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations of their own, and to be put to live upon the charity of others: for, in ſuch a caſe are ſeveral of the Lord's People here ſuppoſed to be, while the Apoſtle commandeth them to <hi>uſe hospitality one towards another.</hi> 2. The Lord doth not ordinarily bring all of His People in a like hard condition at once, but in hardeſt times uſeth to keep ſome of them in a capacity to be helpfull, and comfortable to others: for, while there are ſome that want lodging and accommodation of their own, there are others of His People that have theſe things to give to ſuch as want them, as is ſuppoſed in this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Uſe hospitality one to another.</hi> 3. Although hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws do not bind Chriſtians to the duties of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor puniſh them for the neglect thereof; yet the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Law-giver hath enjoyned theſe duties as ſtrictly as any other, and therefore, no queſtion, will be as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the neglecters of theſe duties, as of any other duties, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.44. for, this Text is the poors right to a ſhare of the accommodations and ſociety of the rich, and the Lords order to the rich, for giving the ſame to the poor; <hi>Uſe hospitality one to another.</hi> 4. Duties of charity to the Lord's People in neceſſity, ought to be done without fretting or male-contentment, either at the poor as being burthenſom, or at God's providence for caſting ſo many objects of charity in our way; and conſequently they ought to be gone about willingly and pleaſantly, conſidering, that the Lord eſteemeth of them as done to Himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. and that He delighteth exceedingly in our chearfull performance of ſuch duties as are expenſive to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. for, thus doth the Apoſtle qualifie the right manner of performing this duty of hoſpitality, that it be uſed <hi>without grudging.</hi>

                  <p>The ſixth direction which the Apoſtle inferreth upon the former arguments, is, That they would mutually communicate all their receipts for the glory of Chriſt, and the good of others: and this he preſſeth by two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: The one is, That what-ever they had, was a free-gift, flowing from the grace of God. The other is, That they were not abſolute owners, but diſpenſers, or ſtewards of thoſe various gifts and graces of God. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There are none of the Lord's People but they have received ſome gifts from Him, which being rightly employed, may be made forth-coming for His glory, and the good of others of His People: this is ſuppoſed while the Apoſtle thus exhorts, <hi>As every man hath received the gift, ſo let him miniſter the ſame, &amp;c. that God in all things may be glorified.</hi> 2. It hath pleaſed the Lord to diſpenſe His gifts variouſly among His People, giving to ſome moe talents, and to ſome fewer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15. and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent meaſures of the ſame gifts to ſeveral perſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. that all may know, all fulneſſe is only in Himſelf, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. and that every one may make uſe of that gift, or degree of gift in another which themſelves want, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. for, this variety of the Lord's diſpenſing of His gifts, is imported in this direction of the Apoſtle's, while he thus exhorts in the beginning of the Verſe, <hi>As every man hath received the gift, &amp;c.</hi> and while he calleth thoſe gifts, in the latter part of the Verſe, <hi>the manifold grace of God.</hi> 3. What-ever gift or talent any of the Lord's People have, that may be any way uſefull for His glory, and the good of others, that is a free-gift to them, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the undeſerved grace of God, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing foreſeen or found in any that can merit the leaſt good at Gods hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. as is clearly held forth in the ſignification of this word, <hi>As every man hath received
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105751:100"/>
the Gift.</hi> 4. None of the Lord's People have received any gift from Him, for themſelves alone, but that they may lay forth the ſame for His glory, and the good of others, as is imported in this direction, <hi>As every man hath received the gift, ſo let him miniſter the ſame.</hi> 5. The Children of the Lord have much need of His Spirit, that they may diſcern the gifts they have received, and ſo may know what is freely beſtowed upon them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12, that they may neither undervalue their receipts as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and ſo hide their talents in a napkin, nor yet take upon them what they are not able for, but may put forth their gifts in their ſtations, for the glory of God, and others good, ſuitably to the meaſure they have received, <hi>As every man hath received the gift, ſo let him miniſter the ſame.</hi> 6. All our receipts ought to be communicated with much diligence and activity, as alſo with humble condeſcendency to profit thoſe that are inferiour to us, as being in that, ſervants to others: for, both <hi>diligence,</hi> and <hi>condeſcendency,</hi> are imported in the ſignification of this word, <hi>Let him miniſter the ſame.</hi> 7. The conſideration of the freedom of God's grace in beſtowing any of His gifts, ſhould ſtrongly move all His People heartily to lay out the ſame for His glory, and the good of others: for, that we may never think upon any of our receipts but as free-gifts, and thereby may be moved to communicate the ſame, the Spirit of the Lord hath put ſuch a name up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them here, as in the Original ſignifieth a <hi>gift of grace,</hi> and a gift whereby others may be gratified; <hi>As every man hath received the gift.</hi> 8. The Lord's People are not to look upon themſelves as owners of any gifts they have, ſo as they may uſe the ſame at their pleaſure, but as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſators and ſtewards, as the word here ſignifies, who ought to diſpoſe of their receipts according to the mind and direction of the giver of them, communicating the ſame ſeaſonably and with diſcretion, conſidering the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tempers of the reſt of the family, to whom they are to give out theſe gifts, and faithfully, as thoſe that muſt give account, how they have imployed all that they have

                  <p>The laſt direction, is concerning the right manner of communicating their receipts: for which the Apoſtle giveth two inſtances, The firſt is, anent the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of things ſpiritual, which are to be communicated by word: and for that, he exhorteth that it be done (whether by publick Miniſters, or private Chriſtians in their ſtations (with that reverence and confidence which is ſutable to the majeſty and certainty of divine Truths. The ſecond is, concerning the right way of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things temporal; and for this he exhorteth, that thoſe be given forth (whether by all Chriſtians, whom charity obligeth to ſupply one anothers neceſſities, or by thoſe who have an Office in the Houſe of God, to gather and diſtribute the charity of the reſt) in a way ſuitable to every ones ability, and with ſuch a willing and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame of ſpirit as the Lord vouchſafes upon them; and withall he propoſeth the right end that Chriſtians ſhould have before them, in all their duties, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this, the communication of their receipts, to wit, the glorifying of God through Jeſus Chriſt: upon the mentioning whereof, the Apoſtles heart riſes, to aſcribe eternal praiſe to him, wherewith the firſt part of the Chapter is cloſed. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. All that ſpeak any thing to others of the matters of God (as private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in a private way may do, for their mutual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. eſpecially to theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their charge, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4.) more eſpecially, thoſe who

have an Office in the Houſe of God for that end, ought to ſtudy the right manner of delivering the mind of God, that they ſpeak nothing but what they underſtand, &amp; are clearly perſwaded to be His Truth, as the word here ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies; that they ſpeak the ſame with plainneſs, that there may be no ground for people to doubt of the meaning, as ordinarily there is of Satan's oracles, which uſe to be doubtſom and ambiguous; that they ſpeak ſeaſonably, with reverence &amp; humility as becomes the mind of God: All which is imported in this direction, preſcribing the right manner of communicating ſpiritual receipts, which is to be done by ſpeech, <hi>If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi> 2. As every Chriſtian ought willingly to give out of his worldly ſubſtance for the ſupply of the neceſſities of others of the Lord's People, and that with due conſideration how far his ability may reach, ſo, as his charity may neither be unſuitable to the Lord's libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality towards him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. nor prejudicial to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of equity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. eſpecially to thoſe of his near relations, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. So, thoſe who have an Office in the Houſe of God, for gathering and diſtributing the charity of others, ought to diſcharge the ſame with faithfulneſſe and diligence, chearfully going about the meaneſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uty of their office: for, this laſt part of the Apoſtle's directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be underſtood both of the Deacons, and of every private Chriſtian, and likewiſe of the proportion which ſhould be betwixt their charity, and their ability; as alſo, of their ſtretching themſelves to the utmoſt of the grace given unto them, to do thoſe duties of charity in a right manner; <hi>If any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth.</hi> 3. As there is a great prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all men naturally, whereof the Regenerate are not free, to ſeek their own glory, eſpecially in the giving out of their receipts, as is imported in the Apoſtle's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this end to Believers in the communication of their gifts, that God may be glorified: So, none can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably imploy their beſt gifts, unleſſe their main end be, that God he giver may be praiſed, both by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105751:102"/>
of theſe gifts, and by thoſe that are profited by them, for giving ſuch gifts to men, and the heart to let them forth for ſo holy an end as this, <hi>that God in all things may be glorified.</hi> 4. As every gift we have, comes to us through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.16. So, all the glory that redounds to God by the right uſe of theſe gifts, muſt be given to Him, (whether by the diſpenſer of them, or thoſe who are profited by them) through Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe ſtrength they are rightly imployed, <hi>Job.</hi> 15.5. who makes His People intend the glory of God in all things, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.3. <hi>Job.</hi> 17.10. and makes their intention to glorifie Him, accepted by His merits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. for, this glorifying of God, which is here propoſed, as the end to be intended both by them that let out their gifts to others, and by thoſe to whom they are diſpenſed, muſt be through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That God in all things may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 5. Although the eſſential glory of God be ſo infinitly great, that it can receive no addition, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.5. and His dominion in it ſelf ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and large, that it cannot be more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. Yet, it is the duty of all His People, eſpecially His Miniſters, to declare that glory of His, to wiſh that it may be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Him by all, and that His dominion may be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily acknowledged and ſubmitted to by all: for, ſo doth the Apoſtle here, <hi>To Him be glory and dominion for ever.</hi> 6. So full of deſires, to have Chriſt glorified and ſubmitted unto by others, ſhould the hearts of all that love Him, eſpecially His Miniſters, be, that they ſhould be ready to intermit other purpoſes, and burſt forth in His praiſe, thereby to provoke others to that duty: for, ſo doth the Apoſtle here, <hi>To Him be glory and dominion for ever.</hi> 7. Our deſires to have the glory of the Lord manifeſted, and His dominion over all acknowledged, and willingly ſubmitted unto, ſhould reach the length of eternity, in regard we are obliged to Him by favours of infinit worth, for which we will never be able to give Him the glory due to Him, <hi>To whom be glory and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for ever.</hi> 8. We ought to raiſe our hearts in praiſe,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105751:102"/>
by the conſideration of the Lord's faithfulneſſe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of His Promiſes, and to cloſe that exerciſe for the time with the hearty acknowledgment thereof, and with our faithful engaging of our ſelves to glorifie Him, by believing of His faithfulneſſe: for, this Hebrew word, <hi>Amen,</hi> ſignifying faithfulneſſe, is uſed in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, importing that all tongues ſhould, and muſt at laſt give to God the glory of faithfulneſſe; and is made the ordinary cloſe of our prayers and praiſes, to ſignifie our acknowledgment of His faithfulneſſe, and engaging of our ſelves faithfully to every duty that may honour Him. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     </gap>ore ought to be well taken. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſtians under a croſſe, eſpecially for Chriſt, and Truth, ſtand in need of frequent directions and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and thoſe born-in with much affection, they being then in hazard to take ſome ſinfull courſe for their eaſe, or elſe to ſuffer heartleſly, and in a way unbeſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Maſter; and ready alſo to think themſelves forgotten, or ſlighted by others: for which, and the like cauſes, it is, that the Apoſtle, having been upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of directing and encouraging ſufferers frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Epiſtle, doth here return to it again, and make way for it by this loving compellation, <hi>Beloved, think it not ſtrange, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The Children of the Lord
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105751:103"/>
have not only trials, but <hi>fiery trials</hi> to prepare for, which are ſuch as do deprive them of the ſweeteſt of earthly comforts, and reaches to that which is deareſt to them, as men, their credit, liberty and life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. and ſuch as few Profeſſors will abide, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. for, ſuch trials are the Godly here forewarned of, and ſuppoſed to be in, while the Apoſtle thus directs, <hi>Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial.</hi> 3. So unwilling are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord to forecaſt ſore trials, and ſo make them familiar to themſelves before they come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. ſo ſubject to ſecurity, even when trials are neareſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.40. ſo ready to dream of much worldly eaſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6. and when they get but a little breathing-time from trouble, to promiſe themſelves perpetual exemption ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6. that they are in great hazard to be ſurprized and perplexed at the ſight of approaching tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, as men uſe to be at the ſight of any thing ſtrange and terrible, which they did not forecaſt and prepare for; as is imported in this direction. <hi>Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, &amp;c. as though ſome ſtrange thing had happened unto you.</hi> 4. How fiery ſoever the trials of the Lord's People be, there is no reaſon why they ſhould ſeem ſtrange to them, ſeing they are ſo frequently forewarned of them in Scripture, conſidering that the beſt of the Saints, and the Captain of our ſalvation, have gone through as hot, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. and eſpecially that they are aſſured of one with them in the hotteſt furnace of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction they can be put in, who will quench the violence of the fire, that it ſhall not conſume them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2, 5. Therefore they ſhould <hi>not think it ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, as though ſome ſtrange thing had happened unto them.</hi> 5. One main end for which the Lord exerciſeth His People with fiery trials, is. That they may have proof of the ſtrength of His grace in them for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. and a diſcovery of the weakneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo, and of the much droſſe of corruption which is with it, for their humiliation and purging, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. for, this the Apoſtle affirmeth of the hotteſt ſufferings of the

The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of thoſe excellent advantages which the Lord's People have by trials, ſhould guard their hearts againſt offence thereat: for this, that afflictions are but to try them, is here held forth as a ſpecial reaſon why they ſhould not take uncouth with them; <hi>Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, That by their ſufferings for Chriſt, they were made conform to Him in His ſuffering, and did partake of the fruits of His ſufferings for them. The other is, That their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Chriſt were to them ſure pledges, and forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their ſharing with Him of His glory, at His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is not enough for the Lord's People to have their hearts kept free of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement under the croſſe, or amazement at it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a ſtrange lot; but they ought alſo to rejoyce in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Chriſt, as the matter of their great honour and happineſſe: which frame of ſpirit may be attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, under the hotteſt trials wherewith the Lord's People can be exerciſed: for, after the Apoſtle hath exhorted them not to think it ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, he addeth this ſecond direction, <hi>But rejoyce, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Thoſe who are honoured to ſuffer for Chriſt, do in a ſpecial manner partake of His ſufferings, in regard they have a ſpecial meaſure of that wiſdom and ſtrength which he purchaſed by his death, communicated to them under

In all which reſpects, ſufferers may be ſaid to partake of the ſufferings of Chriſt; every one whereof ought to be a ſtrong motive to chearfulneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy under ſufferings for Him: for, to this end doth the Apoſtle give this reaſon, comprehending all theſe priviledges, <hi>In as much as ye are partakers of the ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi> 3. Although Chriſt's eſſential glory be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one and the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. Yet His declarative or manifeſted glory is ſometimes much hid and vailed, as it was in a ſpecial way during the time of His perſonal humiliation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. and will be ſo, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, till all His ſuffering-Members ſhare of His glory at the laſt day, at which time He ſhall be clearly manifeſted to be fully glorious; as is imported in this other reaſon of joy in ſuffering for Chriſt, <hi>That when His glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the fulneſſe of the joy of His People, till the time of the full manifeſtation of His own glory at His laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, that His own may long much for that day, and may not take it ill to ſuſpend their joy, while His glory is under a vail; for, <hi>when His glory ſhall be revealed, they ſhall be glad with exceeding joy.</hi> 5.

                  <p>The Apoſtle addeth to the former three arguments, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, to encourage them againſt their ſufferings. The fourth is, That even their induring diſgracefull ſpeeches for Chriſt, ſhould prove a mean and evidence of their happineſſe; and therefore much more their greater ſufferings. The fifth, which explains their happineſſe, is, That the glorious Spirit of the Lord delighteth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the hearts of ſufferers; which muſt be underſtood of ſome ſpecial operations of His, ſeing He dwelleth, or reſteth, in the hearts of all His own, whether they be put to ſuffering, or not. The ſixth is, That the reproaching of the Godly, is taken as done againſt that glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God reſiding in them. And, the ſeventh is, That their conſtant enduring of that, and other degrees of their ſufferings, is eſteemed much glory to that glorious Spirit. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.

As there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of trials where with the Lord's People are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and every one are not tried with the ſame kind; So the Lord takes notice of all the degrees and kinds of their trials, were it but an envious look, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.9. or the leaſt diſdainful geſture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.9. and will not ſuffer the leſſer ſort of their ſufferings to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Even thoſe who are not put to the hotteſt kind of ſufferings, are ready to miſcarry, and be diſcouraged under the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, becauſe the beſt are not eaſily brought to deny their own ſtrength, till they be under ſome extremity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. for, this is imported in the Apoſtle's guarding and comforting againſt reproach, <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye.</hi> 4. The conſideration of the greatneſs of the reward, which the Lord graciouſly beſtoweth upon the leaſt degree of ſuffering for Him, ſhould make His People joyfully undergo the greateſt and moſt fiery of their trials; If it be a happineſſe to be reproached for His ſake, it muſt be a great happineſſe to be killed for his ſake: for, the Apoſtle makes this a reaſon why they ſhould rejoyce under fiery trials, that to be reproached for Him, was a happy thing; <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye.</hi> 5. It is not the ſufferings of Chriſtians, but the cauſe for which they do ſuffer, which makes them happy, to wit, their ſuffering for the profeſſion of the Name of Chriſt, for adhering to His Truth, and their duty to Him, and out of reſpect to His glory: for, this is the qualification of a right ſufferer, who may count himſelf happy in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The more glorious and conſtant the reſidence of Chriſt's Spirit in the hearts of His ſuffering-people appeareth to be, the more inraged will their profane perſecutors be to ſpeak evil of that Spirit that dwelleth in them, which they will be eſteemed to do (though they do not expreſly blaſpheme the Spirit) when they father the operations of the Spirit upon Satan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24.28. or, when they wilfully reſiſt and oppoſe His known mind delivered to them, by His ſuffering-people, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. for, though the Spirit of glory, and of God reſt upon theſe perſecuted Saints, Yet, upon the part of their perſecutors <hi>He is evil ſpoken of.</hi> 10.

                  <p>Here is a third direction for attaining to a right car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in a time of perſecution; the ſum whereof is, That as they deſire to find the ſweetneſſe of the former conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which the Apoſtle had held forth to ſufferers, they would keep themſelves free of thoſe evils, which even Heathen Magiſtrates, under whoſe power they lived, would readily puniſh; ſuch as, wronging the perſons, or eſtates of their neighbours, medling with things without the bounds of their calling, and other wickedneſſes of that ſort, So ſhould they be the leſſe moved with their ſufferings. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of thoſe who have power and authority over others, to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves keepers of both the Tables of the Law of God, by puniſhing without reſpect of perſons, not only the groſſer
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105751:106"/>
ſorts of tranſgreſſions, ſuch as murder, and theft, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men injure the perſons or eſtates of their neighbours: but alſo thoſe more ſubtil and ſpecious ſins, ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the rights of others, going beyond the bounds of folks calling, which often are vailed with the pretences of zeal for God, and the publick good, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3. which kind of ſins the Apoſtle underſtands here, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſie in other mens matters; Yea, all other known iniquities, whether againſt the firſt Table, ſuch as idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Job</hi> 31.26, 27, 28. blaſphemie, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.11. Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.32. Or againſt the ſecond, ſuch as diſobedience to parents, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.18, &amp;c. adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>Job</hi> 31.11. All which, and the like, are iniquities to be puniſhed by the Judge, and are comprehended here under this general clauſe, <hi>evil doers:</hi> for, the Apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth here, that even Chriſtians, being found guilty of any of thoſe iniquities, ought to be put to ſuffer for them, while he giveth them this caution, <hi>But let none of you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a buſie-body in other mens matters.</hi> 2. Even natures light will ſpeak againſt the toleration of ſeveral ſorts of evils, and will not ſuffer men that have power, and have not put out that light, by frequent ſinning againſt it, to paſſe them without puniſhment; What a ſhame then is it for theſe within the Church to commit ſuch things, or tolerate them in others? For, the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth here, that Chriſtians who lived under Heathen Magiſtrates, would certainly be put to ſuffer by them, if they were found <hi>murderers, thieves, evil-doers, or buſie-bodies in other mens matters.</hi> 3. As it is the duty of every one who by their miſcarriage have deſerved the ſtroak of humane juſtice, willingly to ſubmit to the ſame, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.41. So it ſhould be the great care of the Lord's people to eſchew thoſe ſins which may draw them under that ſtroak, it being a great reproach to Chriſtianity, when the profeſſors of it, are found guilty of thoſe things, which even Heathens, or ſuch as are no better, cannot but puniſh, and a great hardening of wicked men in their evil ways: for which,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:105751:107"/>
and the like cauſes, the Apoſtle giveth this third directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>But let none of you ſuffer as a murderer, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Chriſtians imploy Chriſt's Spirit to apply that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which He hath purchaſed by His death, for the changing of their nature, and mortifying of the love of ſin in their hearts, and ſtudy watchfulneſſe in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they will readily break out in thoſe abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for which even Heathens would juſtly put them to ſuffer: for, this direction of the Apoſtle's, doth import, that except Chriſtians did watch and pray, and make uſe of Chriſt's death for mortification of ſin within, to which duties he had ſtirred them up before they were in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to break out in the ſins here mentioned, and ſo be put to <hi>ſuffer as murderers, thieves, evil-doers, and buſie-bodies in other mens matters.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle giveth ſome further directions for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fore-mentioned end. The fourth in number, is implied in the beginning of this Verſe, That they ſhould cleave to the profeſſion of the Name and Truth of Chriſt, carrying themſelves under their ſufferings, as His anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones; upon which he inferreth the fifth, That if they did ſo ſuffer, they ought not to be aſhamed of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; But on the contrary, (which is a ſixth directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they ſhould take occaſion from ſuch ſufferings, of giving much glory to God, for honouring and enabling them ſo to ſuffer. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. They that would have true comfort under their ſufferings for Chriſt, muſt firſt ſtudy to be real Chriſtians, taught of Chriſt to know Him, and His will, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.26. to have from Him the anointing of His Spirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20. whereby they are made in ſome meaſure to reſemble Him in His nature and diſpoſition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and in His Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to which He is anointed, by having power over their luſts; and in His ſtrength, overcoming all oppoſition in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105751:107"/>
the way of their duty, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. as anointed Kings to God, by offering up themſelves in a ſacrifice to God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and their ſervice through Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. as a ſpiritual Prieſthood; by communicating the knowledge of Chriſt to others, eſpecially thoſe under their charge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. whereby they do reſemble Him in the exerciſe of his Prophetical Office; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be conform to Him, in ſuffering for Him, and ſhewing forth that meekneſſe and conſtancy, and other of His communicable perfections, which ſhined in Him under his ſufferings, avowing his Name, and Offices, to which He is anointed, upon all hazards: for, this is to <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as a Chriſtian</hi> (whoſe name is an anointed one) which the Apoſtle here implies as neceſſary for all that would taſt the ſweetneſſe of the former conſolations; <hi>But if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed.</hi> 2. Profane Chriſtians who may be juſtly put to ſuffer for their faults, are very ready to entitle themſelves to the honour of ſuffering for Chriſt; and therefore, it concerneth Chriſt's Miniſters to clear the cauſe of ſuffering, in which Chriſtians may comfort themſelves, and the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſuffering for a right cauſe: for, the Apoſtle in this, and the preceding Verſe, ſetteth a guard about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſolations given to ſufferers for Chriſt, leſt they might be uſurped by profane profeſſors, juſtly put to ſuffer for their miſcarriage; <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a murderer, &amp;c. but if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed.</hi> 3. There is no ſhame or contempt that the world can pour upon ſufferers for Chriſt, whereof they ought to be aſhamed, but rather to deſpiſe ſhame for Him, as He did for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. as they would not have Him dealing with them as if He were aſhamed of them another day, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. for, this is the fifth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>If any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed.</hi> 4. When the Lord by His providence brings a neceſſity upon Chriſtians of ſuffering for Him, and his Truth, and by his grace enableth them to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves chriſtianly under the ſame, they owe much praiſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105751:108"/>
and glory to Him for putting that honour upon them: eſpecially conſidering, that His grace alone hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their falling in thoſe ſins, which might juſtly have brought them to no leſſe ſuffering, and with far leſſe credit and comfort, than now, while they are put to ſuffer for Chriſt, and their duty to Him: for, this is the ſixth direction, <hi>Let him glorifie God on this behalf,</hi> to wit, that he is put to ſuffer not as a <hi>thief, or a murderer, but as a Chriſtian.</hi>

                  <p>Here are two further arguments to move the Godly to courage and conſtancy under their ſufferings; the one is, That now God's appointed and fit opportunity was come, wherein he would have his juſt diſpleaſure againſt the ſins of men, beginning firſt to kyth in his own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Church, under the New Teſtament, by trouble and perſecution, for the correction and trial of his own; and therefore they had no reaſon to faint under theſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, ſeing the time of them was of God's appointment, and that the Godly were only to endure the beginning of that which would make an end of their perſecutors. The other argument is, That ſeing God's juſt diſpleaſure againſt ſin, was firſt manifeſted toward his own People, the end of their wicked enemies behoved to be unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably terrible, and therefore they had no reaſon to fear ſufferings from them, nor to joyn with them in their evil wayes to eſchew the ſame. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Trouble and perſecution cannot ariſe in the Church when wicked men pleaſe to plot it, or ſet a time to the beginning of it, were their power, policy and malice never ſo great, but only when that fit and prefixed opportunity (as the word here ſignifieth) is come, which hath been condeſcended upon in the eternal councel of God, who hath alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined how long the troubles of the Church ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,

                  <p>Here the Apoſtle cleareth his former argument, to this purpoſe, That if even juſtified perſons, and holy walkers, had ſuch a hard lot in the world, that they could not but with great difficulty, and through many fiery tryals win to the Kingdom of Heaven. Thoſe who did caſt off all Religion, and gave themſelves up to all wickedneſſe, might expect in the day of God's reckoning with them, to find no place to ſhelter themſelves from his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath; and therefore there was no reaſon why the Godly ſhould fear them, or joyn with them in their evil wayes, to ſhun ſufferings from them, ſeing their end ſhould be ſo terrible. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all that flie to Chriſt, and take themſelves to the ſtudy of holineſſe, be moſt ſure, in regard of Chriſt's undertaking to cauſe them perſevere till they come to it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. and the way to that ſalvation be in it ſelf ſweet, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. and in regard of Chriſt's large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſtrength and comfort, eaſie to the renewed man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. Yet, conſidering the many fiery trials that are in the way, and the Believers own weakneſſe, it is no eaſie matter for them to win through to the poſſeſſion thereof; The conſideration of which difficulty ſhould be ſo far from diſcouraging them in the way, that it ſhould provoke them to put on much reſolution to hold on that way in Chriſts ſtrength, notwithſtanding all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties: for, not the poſſibility of the Elects loſing ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but the difficulty of attaining it, by reaſon of many trials, and their own weakneſſe, is imported in this expreſſion, as a motive to conſtancy, <hi>If the righteous ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> 2. While the Lord's People are ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wicked perſons proſpering, they ſhould put their hearts frequently to conſider how wofull, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably terrible the end of theſe wicked enemies muſt be, when they ſhall be forced to appear before their

Judge, and ſhall find no place to ſhelter them from his fierce wrath, which ſhall purſue them to Hell, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them there for ever; that by ſuch thoughts the ſuffering-Children of God, may be moved neither to envie them for their preſent proſperity, nor incline to joyn with them in their ſinful courſes, for eſchewing trouble from them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.1, 2, &amp;c. and 73.2, 17. but rather to endure ſufferings from them, that they may not ſhare with them in their wofull end: for, that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might not run with their proſpering perſecutors to the ſame exceſſe of riot, nor faint under ſufferings from them, The Apoſtle doth again repreſent to their hearts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their unſpeakably terrible end, by this other queſtion, <hi>Where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear?</hi> 3. The conſideration of this difficulty in the way of the Godlie's ſalvation, is ſufficient to convince us, that their end muſt be unſpeakably terrible, who are ſo far from taking paint to be ſaved, that they ſhake off all duties of Religion, as the word, <hi>ungodly,</hi> ſignifies; and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to all wickedneſſe, as the word, <hi>ſinners,</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſo haſt their own deſtruction: for, ſo much is imported in the connexion of the firſt part of this Verſe, with the latter; <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear?</hi>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:105751:110"/>
whatever they did ſuffer, was carved out to them, not by the luſt of men, but by the good-will of their God. The other is, That under their ſufferings for well-doing, they might be at quietneſſe concerning the eternal ſalvation of their ſouls, and their through-bearing till they come to the poſſeſſion thereof, having put them in his hand, who is both able to ſave them, having made them, and all things, of nothing; and in teſtimony of his good-will to ſave them, hath engaged his faithfulneſſe in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for that end: and therefore Believers had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but to go on chearfully and conſtantly in their duty, notwithſtanding of all their ſufferings. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The conſideration of the difficulty that is in the way of the ſalvation of the Lord's People, by reaſon of the many fiery trials they have to go through, ſhould ſtir them up to make ſure work about their ſouls, by putting them in Chriſts hand, ſo ſhall they have courage and ſtrength under their ſufferings: for, this laſt direction is inferred upon the former purpoſe, as the firſt word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth clear, <hi>Wherefore, let them that ſuffer, &amp;c. commit the keeping of their ſouls to Him.</hi> 2. The Lord's People ſhould more highly eſteem of, and be more ſolicitous about, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They that have committed the keeping of their ſouls to Jeſus Chriſt, as they would have comfort under their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, muſt hold on in the way of well-doing; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that however their ſouls that are committed to him,

The third is, That he did by faith ſhare with them, and other Believers, of the right unto, and firſt-fruits of, that bleſſedneſſe which Chriſt had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and will in due time manifeſt to his Redeemed Ones: All which conſiderations might move them to take an up-ſtirring meſſage well off his hand. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Even in the midſt of perſecution, and while the Lord's People are in exile, and under the power of enemies to the Truth, the Lord can keep up a ſtanding Miniſtery, and his Ordinances among them, in deſpight of Satan and all his inſtruments: for, the Apoſtle; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the diſperſed, and perſecuted Chriſtian Jews ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them to have Officers, and thoſe Officers to have opportunity of going about their duty, while he thus exhorts them to it, <hi>The Elders which are among you I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Even thoſe whoſe calling it is, to ſtir up others to their duty, and in whom there is no ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable defect in the diſcharge of their duty, as deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth any publick notice to be taken of it, have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, great need to be very earneſtly ſtirred up to greater diligence and progreſſe in their duty, than what
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:105751:112"/>
they have already attained, there being in the beſt, even of Chriſt's Miniſters, a ſtrong party drawing them back from their duty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. and at their beſt much ſhort-coming in what they might attain unto, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.12, 13. for, here the Spirit of the Lord, whoſe love ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him publiſh the faults of his deareſt Servants, when it is neceſſary, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. Although he ſee it not meet before the Church in this Epiſtle, to reprove the Officers for any failing, Yet doth he by his Apoſtle very earneſtly ſtir them up to their duty: <hi>The Elders which are among you I exhort, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The duties of Miniſters, and other Office-bearers of the Church, ought to be preſſed upon them in the hearing of the People, that ſo thoſe Officers may be the more engaged to their duty, and the People the more able to diſcern betwixt thoſe of them that are conſcionable in the diſcharge of their duty, and others that are not; Therefore the Apoſtle doth not ſatisfie himſelf to write to the Church-Officers concerning their duty in any private Letter, directed to themſelves alone, but doth inſiſt upon their duty in this publick Letter, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the whole Church; and while he beginneth to deal with the Officers, he directeth his ſpeech to the People, <hi>The Elders which are among you I exhort, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Thoſe that bear Office in the Houſe of God, ought to be ſuch as are come to ſome maturity of age, and ſuch as are of ſome conſiderable ſtanding in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. and eſpecially ſuch, as for their wiſdom, experience, and gravity may deſerve that reverence and reſpect which is ſuitable for the aged: for, this ſtile of <hi>Preſbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> here given to the Officers of the Church, may be ſafely conceived both to point at their age, and their qualifications ſuitable to the aged, <hi>The Elders that are among you.</hi> 5. Chriſt's Miniſters have not only the charge of his Flock, but alſo of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers with whom they have ſociety or correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence in the Work of the Lord, and ſo are bound to ſtir up and encourage one another in their duty: for, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

No Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Jeſus Chriſt ought to affect or uſurp any ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over other Miniſters, conſidering how much Chriſt was diſpleaſed with it in his own Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.25, 26. And that this great Apoſtle, from whom the Antichriſtian Church pretendeth her warrant for Prelacy among Miniſters, while he ſpeaketh to other Church-officers, holdeth forth himſelf only as their equall, <hi>Who am alſo an Elder.</hi> 7. As the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to take well with exhortation to their duty, even from the people under their charge, who, though they have no juriſdiction over their Officers, to call them to a judicial accompt, or inflict cenſures upon them for their faults, which doth belong to their Fellow-presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. Yet they have good warrant to warn them of their duty, and incite them to it, with due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and modeſty ſuitable to their ſtation, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. So ſhould they receive counſel and warning, eſpecially from their Fellow-labourers, who ought to have more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and skill than ordinarily the people have, to point out the duty of Church-officers, and ought to be looked upon by other Officers who hear them point out their duty, as having a calling from God through vertue of their Office ſo to do: for, the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Officers of the Church, makes this an argument to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them, that he who brought this meſſage, was <hi>alſo an Elder.</hi> 8. It is no eaſie thing for one of Chriſt's Miniſters to prevail with others of that ſame ſacred Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, by counſel and exhortation, every one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to lift up themſelves above another, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.24. and at the apprehenſion of that frame of ſpirit in their Fellow-labourers, to have their paſſions ſtirred againſt them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.24. The conſideration whereof ſhould move every Miniſter to much humility and loving-ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe in dealing with their Fellow-labourers: for,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:105751:113"/>
the Apoſtle doth here uſe many inſinuations upon the Church-guides, as arguments to bear-in his following exhortations upon them, thereby importing ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of prevailing with them, and is very humbly ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with them, thereby caſting a copie to one Miniſter how to deal with another, as is imported in the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe words, <hi>The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am alſo an Elder.</hi> 9. It pleaſed our Redeemer to ſuffer before witneſſes, both in his agony in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.37. and upon the Croſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.39. and likewiſe to imploy ſome of theſe Witneſſes to preach Him crucified to the Church, thereby condeſcending to beget the greater certainty in the hearts of Believers, that God's juſtice is ſatisfied for them, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.30, 31. to give us the more lively deſcription of his ſufferings, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.15. and to let us know that he hath born ſhame for us, as a part of the puniſhment due to our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. for which, and the like cauſes, the Apoſtle calleth himſelf here, <hi>A Witneſſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi> 10. However theſe whom the Lord makes moſt inſtrumental to gain others to himſelf, may expect a ſpecial reward from him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. Yet everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, or glory, is not a thing proper to them alone, but is the common portion of all faithful Miniſters, and Believers in Jeſus Chriſt: for, the Apoſtle only calleth himſelf <hi>a partaker,</hi> (or, as the word ſignifieth, a ſharer together with others, to wit, the flock of Chriſt, to whom his ſpeech is directed, and their Officers, whoſe duty he preſſeth) <hi>of the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> 11. Although the Saints, in this mortal ſtate, could not well endure the leaſt glimpſe of glory, much leſſe partake of it, as they ſhall do afterward, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.6. Yet even while they are in the midſt of much outward miſery, and in the expectation of more, they have a right, and may attain unto ſome real participation of glory, while they are by faith united with Chriſt the Lord of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. and do ſometimes taſt of the firſt fruits of that whereupon glorified ſpirits do live, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. for, the Apoſtle, a perſecuted man, and looking for martyrdom
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:105751:114"/>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. calleth himſelf <hi>a partaker</hi> (or ſharer with other Believers) <hi>of the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> 12. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt's Miniſters ſhould deteſt the ſeeking of their own glory before the world, as they deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their Maſter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.50. and the beſt of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.6. Yet may they humbly aſſert any ſpecial honour that Chriſt hath put upon them, when it is manifeſt that their ſo doing may tend to his glory, and the advantage of the meſſage they carry: for, that the Apoſtle may make way for the receiving of the meſſage which he hath to the Church-guides, he doth commend himſelf from the honour Chriſt had put upon him, to be a perſonal witneſſe of his ſufferings, and <hi>a partaker of the glory to be revealed.</hi> 13. The greater certainty of the Truth, and comfort by it, appear to be in them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it, and the more charity they may expreſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the good eſtate of thoſe to whom they do deliver it, the better acceptance, and ſucceſſe of their meſſage, may they expect: for, the Apoſtle, that his meſſage might be the better taken, repreſenteth himſelf as one to whom the truth of the Goſpel was moſt certain, he being a witneſſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt, as one that had much courage and comfort in adhering to it, and much charity toward thoſe with whom he dealeth as being <hi>a co-partner with them of the glory to be revealed.</hi>

And likewiſe they ought to have wiſdom authority and equity, for ruling of the Lord's People by the right exerciſe of diſcipline, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cenſures: for, both feeding and ruling is expreſt by one word in both the original languages, to ſignifie that they are joyntly requiſite in every Miniſter, whoſe duty here is mainly held forth, <hi>Feed the Flock, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is not enough for the Miniſters of Chriſt to hold forth ſound and ſaving Truths to his People, in their doctrine, and to rule them by the application of cenſures and diſcipline, unleſſe they alſo take diligent inſpection of their manners, and of their ſeveral conditions and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, by frequent converſing with, and viſiting of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:105751:115"/>
them, as this other word, holding forth their duty, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, without which they can neither apply the Truth, nor cenſures to the People as they ought: for, this is the ſecond principal part of Church-officers duty, eſpecially Miniſters, toward the Flock of God, <hi>taking the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight thereof.</hi> 3. It ſhould provoke Miniſters to fidelity and diligence in their Calling, to conſider that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Charge, are the Flock of God, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will provide for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. and will be very terrible to them that have the charge of them, in caſe they ſlight or wrong them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.2, 10. &amp;c. for, to move the Church-officers to faithfulneſſe and painfulneſſe in their duty, the Apoſtle thus deſigneth the People of their charge, <hi>The Flock of God.</hi> 4. Although none that are ſenſible of their own weakneſſe, and the weight of the charge of ſouls, will be very forward to thruſt themſelves into that employment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.6. Yet, being once called to it, and engaged therein, they ſhould not go about the duties thereof, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained thereunto by their fears, leſt they diſcover their own weakneſſe, or leſt they fall under the cenſure of others, or leſt their own conſcience may vex them for neglect of their duty: for, this is the firſt evil from which the Apoſtle diſſwadeth Chriſt's Miniſters, as that which would mar the right manner of going about their duty, <hi>Not by conſtraint.</hi> 5. There ſhould be in the heart of every faithful-Miniſter, ſo much love to Jeſus Chriſt, ariſing from the ſenſe of his perſonal obligation to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. and ſo great a deſire of the ſalvation of ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33. as may beget in him ſuch a ſtrong inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inward benſel of ſpirit to his duty, that though there were no external conſideration of gain, glory, or the like, to hold him on, Yet may he not be ſuffered to neglect it: for, this is the firſt poſitive qualification of a, Miniſter going rightly about his duty, <hi>But willingly.</hi> 6. Although Chriſt's Miniſters may with his allowance challenge from the People under their charge, a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent means of outward ſubſiſtance, according to their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:105751:115"/>
ability, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. Yet for any of the Miniſters of Chriſt to make their worldly gain their great inducement to undertake that Calling, or their prime encouragement in going about the Duties of it, is a filthy frame of ſpirit, which appears to be in them when they ſtreatch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt to pleaſe them moſt, from whom they expect moſt gain, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.1. and to oppoſe and diſcourage others, from whom they expect leaſt, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.5. for, from this evil, as abominable to God, deteſtable to faithful Miniſters, and a thing that indiſpoſeth them for the right diſcharge of their duty, the Apoſtle here doth diſſwade in the third direction, <hi>Not for filthy lucre.</hi> 7. A Miniſter of Chriſt that would go rightly about his duty, muſt ly in wait for every opportunity thereof, keeping himſelf in ſome fitneſſe of diſpoſition, for every part of his Calling, whether the opportunity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the particular duties thereof do preſently offer or not, as is imported in the fourth direction, which is poſitive; <hi>But of a ready mind.</hi> 8. It is an evil to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred by all that would expect the reward of faithfull Miniſters, to affect or uſurp any lordſhip or dominion, whether over their Fellow-labourers, which appeareth in their ſeeking preference over them, 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. or over the People of their charge; which appeareth, by their taking a way with people rather to compel them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Goſpel, than to perſwade them to it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtles practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. by their making uſe of the Word, or Diſcipline, to vent their own private revenge, or to carry their point by meer violence, and outwearying of thoſe that oppoſe them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.4. contrary to the Apoſtle's precept, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. for, this is the third evil the Apoſtle diſſwadeth from, in his fifth direction, <hi>Neither as being lords over God's heritage.</hi> 9. The Church and People of God are his inheritance, which he hath purchaſed to himſelf with his blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. in which, he is the only Lawgiver, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. and therefore will never caſt off or alienate the ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.14. The conſideration whereof ſhould
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:105751:116"/>
make all afraid to lord it over his People, or to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate this ſtile to themſelves, which is here given to all the Lord's People, as a motive to their Overſeers to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and a diſſwaſive from uſurping dominion over them; <hi>Neither as being lords over God's heritage.</hi> 10. That which doth much compleat the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, is, when with their abilities to teach, and rule, and other inward qualifications, they have alſo ſuch an external converſation, as may be alluring to the Flock to follow, and worthy of their imitation, while they expreſſe in their practice, the graces of God to be in their heart, ſuch as faith and love, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. patience under perſonal injuries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. humility, and ſelf-denial for the good of others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33. and 11.1. for, this is the Apoſtle's laſt direction, without which all the reſt (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they could be where this is wanting) would do little good, <hi>But being enſamples to the Flock.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle, having cleared the duty of the Officers of the Church, he giveth them here in the cloſe of the firſt part of the Chapter, ſome ſtrong motives to fidelity and diligence therein; As firſt, That there was a higher Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd than they, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt the Prince of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, to take an account of them. Secondly That if they were found faithfull and diligent in their duty, they might be ſure of an eminent degree of glory from Chriſt at his ſecond coming. Thirdly, That that glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhould remain alwayes the ſame in it ſelf, and be eternally poſſeſt by them. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The moſt eminent of Chriſt's Servants have no leſſe need of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in their duty, than the meaneſt under their charge; their trials and temptations being often greater than others, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. and they no leſſe ſubject to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, by reaſon of theſe than others, <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.—5, 6. Therefore the Spirit of the Lord findeth it neceſſary here
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:105751:116"/>
to give them encouragement, as he did to the Flock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.13, 14. <hi>And when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a crown.</hi> 2. Jeſus Chriſt is the chief Shepherd, the Prince of Paſtors, the prime Feeder and Ruler (as the word ſignifies) of his own Flock, from whom all the Under-ſhepherds, the Officers of his Houſe, have their Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. their furniture or gifts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, 11. and to whom they muſt all give an account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. who taketh the prime charge of his own Flock, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. and will ſupply to them the defects of the Shepherds under Him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.11. In all which reſpects he is here called <hi>the chief Shepherd.</hi> 3. Albeit the Lord uſeth to give in hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his faithfull Servants worth all their pains in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, either by letting them ſee ſome ſucceſſe of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. or by giving them inward peace from the faith of his approbation, when deſired ſucceſſe is wanting, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.—4.

The reward abiding Chriſt's faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, wherein all the lovers of Chriſt ſhall ſhare in their own meaſure, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.—8. ſhall be exceeding compleat and glorious, as the metaphor of a Crown of glory ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, and ſuch as ſhall never fade or wax old, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all eternity ſhall remain ſtill in its primitive vigour, as if a flower ſhould ſtill keep its faireſt luſtre, and ſweeteſt ſmell; which metaphor, is alſo in the words: and this may comfort them againſt the fading of their reputation among men, which is incident to the beſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.—35. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.16. for, this is here given to the Church-guides, as their great encouragement, that they are <hi>to receive a crown of glory, which fadeth not away.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle, having in the former part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, exhorted the Officers of the Church to their duty; In the ſecond part, he pointeth out the duties of the flock, whom he deſigneth by the name of <hi>younger,</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt part of them are ordinarily younger in years, than their Officers; but, mainly, becauſe in their diſpoſition and carriage toward their Overſeers, they ſhould ſhew ſome reſemblance of that reverence and obedience, which is ſuitable in young ones, toward the aged; And their duty he holdeth forth in ſix directions. The firſt which belongeth to them, conſidered only as they are under the charge of their Officers, is, ſubjection to them in the Lord, which importeth obedience to their meſſage, and reſpect to their perſons. The ſecond, which concerns them mainly as fellow-members of the Church, is, mutual ſubjection of one to another in all the duties of love. The third, which holdeth forth the ſpecial mean of attaining to the former two, is, that they ſhould adorn themſelves with a mean eſteem of themſelves: and this the Apoſtle preſſeth by two arguments; The one is, that the Lord oppoſeth himſelf to them that lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And the other is, that he giveth his favour and grace to them that abaſe themſelves. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of the Lord's People, to be ſubject to their Rulers whom he hath ſet over them in his Church, by ſubmitting to the duties which they preſſe upon them from the Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.22. and to the cenſures they inflict according to the Word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. by affording them ſome means of outward ſubſiſtance, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. and by giving ſome reſpect to their perſons, becauſe of their Office, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. in reſpect whereof, they are lifted up by the Lord above his People, as the word here ſignifies:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:105751:117"/>
for, the ſubſtance of the duty of the flock to their Church Officers, is here by the Apoſtle comprehended in this one word, <hi>Be ſubject.</hi> 2. Whether the Members of the Church be younger or elder in years, they ſhould, in reference to their Overſeers, reſemble that diſpoſition and carriage, which beſeemeth young ones toward the elder, in their earneſt deſire of the Word, and means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation adminiſtred by them, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.3. by depending upon them, as inſtruments, for counſel in their difficult caſes, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. calling for their help and aſſiſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their croſſes, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14. and by their meek ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to cenſures from them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. for, it is mainly in reſpect of the reſemblance that ſhould be betwixt the diſpoſition of the Flock in reference to their Paſtors and Overſeers, and that of Children toward their Parents, or ſuch as have the charge of them, that the Apoſtle thus deſigneth them; <hi>Ye younger be ſubject to the elder.</hi> 3. The obligation of the Lord's People to their duty toward their Overſeers, is no leſſe ſtrait, than that of their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers to their duty toward them, and therefore their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in neglecting their duty can be no leſſe than theirs: for, the Apoſtle beareth in their duty upon them toward their Overſeers, by ſuch a word as importeth an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the ſtrictneſſe of the tye, <hi>Likewiſe ye younger be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the elder.</hi> 4. There is a mutual ſubjection due by every one of the Lord's People toward another, which conſiſts in their condeſcendency to reprove one another in love, for their faults, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. their inſtructing and admoniſhing one another concerning their duty, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. in their taking well with reproofs and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions one from another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5. and in their ſtooping to all the duties of charity one toward another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.—13. and the like. All which is comprehended in this ſecond direction given to the Members of the Church, in reference to their fellow-members; <hi>Yea, all of you be ſubject one to another.</hi> 5. However men appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for deſtruction, do glory in their pride and violence, wherewith they think themſelves adorned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.6.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:105751:118"/>
18, 19. Yet the grace of humility, whereby a Chriſtian hath a mean eſteem of himſelf, flowing from the ſenſe of his own ſinfulneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9. and of the undeſerved goodneſſe of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, 20 whereby he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to prefer others to himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring more eſteem from others than God alloweth him to have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. and 4.6. and taketh well with all chaſtiſements from God as leſſe than his deſerving, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.13. is the prime ornament of Chriſtians, which they ſhould tye about them, and delight to wear, as the word here ſignifies, and be no leſſe aſhamed to appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, than without their clothing; <hi>Be clothed with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> 6. There can be no right diſcharge of any duty that the Lord's People owe to Superiours, inferiours, or equals, until they get from God that humble frame of ſpirit, formerly deſcribed: for, this exhortation may be taken for a mean of attaining to the former duties; <hi>And be clothed with humility.</hi> 7. Although the Lord may ſuffer proud ſinners to proſper in their ſins for a time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.4, 5. Yet he doth ſtill ſtand in battel array (as the word here tranſlated, <hi>to reſiſt,</hi> ſignifieth) againſt them, and will take his fitteſt opportunity to bear down all that live in that ſin of pride, which doth manifeſt it ſelf in the ſlighting of the ſtudy of reconciliation with God through Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. the neglect of clear du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſt by the Word, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.16, 17, 29. and in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe to God for his mercies, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25, 26. The conſideration of which oppoſition from God, ſhould make the ſtudy of humility, lovely; and pride, hateful to the Lord's People, as they would not have God for their party: for, this is a reaſon to preſſe humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud.</hi> 8. The ſweet proofs of God's favour, and the increaſe of the graces of his Spirit, is that which every humble ſinner may expect, which ſhould commend the grace of humilitie to them, and make them ſtudy the exerciſe of it: for, both theſe are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this ſecond argument, preſſing them to put on this ornament, <hi>God giveth grace to the humble.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle doth here again urge his former exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtudy of humility, eſpecially under the croſſe, by two further arguments, The one taken from the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of God, which is able to cruſh the proud, and carry the humble through all their ſtraits.

                     </gap>y of the humble perſon's deliverance, which is promiſed in the ſeaſon fitteſt for it. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Humility is a leſſon ſo hard to be learned, that Chriſt's Miniſters had need to preſſe the ſame frequently upon his People, and ſtudy many arguments to bear it in upon them: for, the Apoſtle, having in the former verſe, by very ſtrong reaſons, perſwaded them to clothe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with that ornament, he doth here again by other arguments, preſſe the ſame in ſubſtance; <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the mighty power of God, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently able to protect and bear through all his Followers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. and to find out, and puniſh all that oppoſe him, or them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.8, 9. ſhould move the Lord's people humbly to ſubmit to their duty, and to the hardeſt diſpenſation in following thereof: for, his Almighty Power, here ſignified by his Hand, is mentioned as a further reaſon of his Peoples humbling of themſelves; <hi>Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God.</hi> 3.

Yet their delivery is made ſure for them, and they are certified by his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Word, that they ſhall be carried through till they meet with it: for, though he do not promiſe here to the humble, that they ſhall be preſently exalted, Yet he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſure of this, that if they humble themſelves under his mighty hand, <hi>they ſhall be exalted.</hi> 4.

                  <p>The fourth direction, which is brought in as a ſpecial mean of attaining to the former, is, that Believers ſhould by faith commit unto the Lord their thorow-bearing in their duty, the event thereof, and all their anxiety about theſe; and that becauſe the Lord's loving providence doth not ſuffer him to neglect them, or any of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Children of the Lord are ſubject to much ſinfull anxiety in following of their duty; which appeareth when they are hindered from their duty, by looking more to their own weakneſſe, and the difficulties in the way of duty, than to the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency promiſed by him that calleth them to it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.11. or when they are diſcouraged in their duty by the apprehenſion of probable hazards in the way of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13. of which evil the Spirit of the Lord would have them ſenſible, while he findeth it neceſſary thus to exhort them; <hi>Caſting all your care on him.</hi> 2. Although it be moſt commendable in Chriſtians, to entertain ſuch a care of diſcharging their duty aright, and of eſchewing what may provoke the Lord in their way of going about it, as ſtirreth them up to much diligence, and employing of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. Yet ſuch a care, whether anent the manner of their going about their duty, or the ſucceſſe and event thereof, as doth diſtract their heart in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:105751:119"/>
duty, and indiſpoſe them for it, is ſinful, and to be ſhaken off by all that would diſcharge their duty acceptably: for, ſo doth the Apoſtle here direct, <hi>Caſting all your care upon him.</hi> 3. The way to be liberated of anxiety and heart-dividing cares, which indiſpoſe for duty, is, by prayer to commend the ſucceſſe and event of our duty, and our thorow-bearing therein to the Lord, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.6. and by faith to commit both to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.3. for, this is here the direction of the Spirit of the Lord for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to freedom from ſinfull anxiety, <hi>Caſting all your care upon him.</hi> 4. The Lord alloweth his Children to caſt upon him all their anxieties, both ſuch as they have about their ſouls and matters of higheſt concernment, and thoſe about their bodies, and leſſer matters; how ſmall ſoever the thing be where-about their heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh anxious, he alloweth them to commit the ſame to him; for, he knoweth that a very ſmall matter is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to occaſion much vexation of ſpirit to his own, <hi>Jona.</hi> 4.8. Therefore doth he thus direct them, to <hi>caſt all their care upon him.</hi> 5. It is not only the priviledge of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that they may disburden themſelves of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful heart-dividing cares, by caſting them over up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord; but it is alſo the very great deſire of our God, that we ſhould not ſink under the inſupportable burden of our own needleſſe cares and fears; Yea, it is his peremptory command, to put theſe off our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which his People may not diſobey, except they would incur his diſpleaſure, and deſtroy themſelves: for, this hath the force of a command, <hi>Caſting all your care upon him.</hi> 6. As no duty can be rightly diſcharged by us while the Lord is not truſted with our thorow-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, and with the event and ſucceſſe thereof, or, while the heart is diſtracted with misbelieving anxiety about theſe; So the truſting of God with theſe, is the beſt way to come ſpeed in every duty: for, the Apoſtle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exhorted before to duties toward their Overſeers, to one another, and to God, he brings in this as a mean of attaining to all theſe, without which none of them could
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:105751:120"/>
be attained unto, <hi>Caſting all your care upon him.</hi> 7. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing anxiety, whereby Chriſtians break themſelves with the burden of theſe cares, which God requireth to be caſt upon him, is one of the greateſt ſigns of pride in the world; and to truſt God with the weight of theſe in following our duty, is a prime evidence of true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: for, this is brought in as a ſpecial way how they ſhould prove themſelves to be humbled under God's mighty hand, and as that without which they could not but declare their pride; as both the conſtruction of the words, and their connexion with the former, do import; <hi>Humble your ſelves, &amp;c. caſting all your care upon him.</hi> 8. Although the Lord be altogether free of ſuch paſſions, as care, ſorrow, and the like, which are in men, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. Yet thoſe of his People that caſt their care upon him, ſhall find no leſſe proofs of his love, both in ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off hazards, ſo far as is neceſſary, and providing every thing needful for them, than if he were as ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for their wel-being as they can be for themſelves; the conſideration whereof, ſhould liberate their hearts of their diſtruſtful cares: for, this is here aſſerted, as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inforcing the fourth direction, <hi>He careth for you.</hi> 9. While the Lord's People take upon themſelves the weight of their matters, and have their hearts diſtracted with cares about their thorow-bearing in, and the event of, their duties, they do not then believe the fatherly providence of God watching over them for their good, the faith whereof could not but baniſh their anxieties: as is imported in the connexion of this reaſon with the direction, <hi>Caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi>

enemy, Satan. And for this end he ſheweth what frame of ſpirit and carriage, becometh a Souldier of Chriſt, in two directions, preparatory to this warfare. The one is, That they ſhould meddle ſparingly with the delights of this preſent life. The other is, That they ſhould ſtill be upon their watch, leſt they be ſurpriſed by their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemies, and to move them hereunto, he deſcribeth their prime enemy, Satan, from his great enimity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied activity, and inſatiable cruelty, as ſo many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to ſobriety and vigilancy. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. They that are moſt conſcionable in their duty, and have come neareſt to the right manner of going about it, have reaſon to make them for the hotteſt battel, and foreſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults from Satan, to hinder or diſcourage them therein: for, the Apoſtle (having directed the Flock of Chriſt in the former words, to their ſeveral duties, and to the right manner of going about them, with humility and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,) doth here exhort them to prepare for a battel in that way, and for this end thus inſtructeth them for it, <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant: becauſe your adverſary &amp;c.</hi> 2.

Satan is ſuch an enemy as in oppoſing the Lord's People, pleadeth Law and Equity upon his ſide, and by
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:105751:121"/>
Law would carry his point againſt all that are come of <hi>Adam,</hi> were it not Chriſt hath freed Law-breakers, who believe in him, from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. for, this ſtile of Satan's, <hi>Your adverſary,</hi> imports, an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in ſome ſuit of Law. 5. Of all the enemies of the People of God, whereof they have many both within, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. and without, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.1. Satan is the chief, acting in, and by all the reſt, and far exceeding them all in power and policy, and therefore to be eſpecially wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt and oppoſed: for, he is here called, <hi>That adverſary the Devil.</hi> 6. Satan watcheth all poſſible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of prevailing againſt the Children of the Lord by his temptations, compaſſing them round about, that he may eſpy where they are weakeſt, or leaſt afraid of hazard, that there he may aſſault them: for, he is an <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary that goeth about.</hi> 7. There is no outwearying of Satan in this warfare, by never ſo much oppoſition or frequent diſappointments, he is ſtill in action againſt the Lord's People, which ſhould provoke them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant watchfulneſſe and imployment of Jeſus Chriſt for ſtrength againſt him: for, his conſtant activity is here ſet forth by a word in the preſent time, as a motive to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and vigilancy, <hi>Your adverſary goeth about.</hi> 8. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is a very powerful enemy and a terrible, and ſo cruel, that no leſſe than the utter deſtruction of ſouls can ſatisfie him: for, he is here deſcribed by the ſimilitude of one of the moſt powerful, terrible, and crueleſt of beaſts, <hi>A roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> 9. All the activity, power, terror, and cruelty of the Devil, ſhould be ſo far from diſcouraging the Lord's People in the battel againſt him, that the conſideration thereof ſhould animate and hearten them to the ſame, conſidering that he is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſpoiled by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. that there is more power to be imployed for Believers than is againſt them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.16. and that victory over Satan is ſure, and near to all Beleivers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. for, as an argument to ſobriety, vigilancy, and the exerciſe of other graces and duties, formerly preſſed upon Believers their adverſary

                  <p>Here is the ſixth and laſt direction, wherein the Apoſtle preſſeth the great duty of ſpiritual Warriours, to wit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of their great enemy, Satan; and withall, holds forth the right way of maintaining that holy warfare againſt him, which is, by conſtant adhering to the truths of the Goſpel, and reſting by faith upon the promiſes thereof, notwithſtanding of all afflictions in that way; to which the Apoſtle giveth this encouragement, That they had all the reſt of the Lord's People in the world for their fellow-ſouldiers, each of them filling up their own meaſure of hardſhip in this battel. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the power and policy of our ſpiritual adverſary be exceeding great, as was ſhown from the former verſe; yet none of Chriſt's Souldiers muſt think of flying from him, or yeelding to him in the leaſt, But muſt make them for a ſtout and peremptory reſiſtance of him in all his temptations; conſidering, that the more place be yeelded unto him, he tyrannizeth the more, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.49, &amp;c. and the more ſtoutly he be oppoſed, the more ground he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. for, this is the order which Chriſt's Souldiers have received from their General Jeſus Chriſt, concerning Satan and his temptations, <hi>Whom reſiſt, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The principal mean whereby Believers beat back Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and his temptations, is their conſtant adhering to the truth of the Goſpel, whatever they may ſuffer for their ſo doing, and their maintaining of their intereſt in Chriſt and the promiſes; both which are comprehended in this direction, holding forth the right manner of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Satan, <hi>Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> 3. The ſtrongeſt of Satan's temptations, are conveyed to the Godly through afflictions, under which his temptations
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:105751:122"/>
are ordinarily moſt prevalent with them, to make them quit the Truth, or their duty, or elſe to ding them from their confidence in adhering to theſe: Therefore the Apoſtle, giving an encouragement to oppoſe Satan's temptations, he ſuiteth the ſame for an afflicted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, importing, that through affliction the greateſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations are ordinarily conveyed to the Godly, <hi>Whom reſiſt, &amp;c. knowing that the ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your Brethren.</hi> 4. It is an ordinary and ſtrong tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation which Satan ſuggeſts to the hearts of the Godly, That they are ſingular, and matchleſſe in their ſufferings; that ſo he may make them queſtion their Fathers affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and put themſelves out of the number of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe of their afflictions: for, this is the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Apoſtle mainly guards the hearts of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers againſt, while he ſaith, <hi>Knowing that the ſame afflictions are accompliſhed in your Brethren that are in the world.</hi> 5. It ought to be a great encouragement to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, in that battel againſt their temptations which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their afflictions, to conſider, that their lot is no harder than the reſt of the Saints of God through the world, from whom they may expect ſympathy, and the help of their prayers: for, this is here given as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the battel againſt Satan's temptations, notwithſtanding of afflictions in the way of their duty, <hi>That the ſame afflictions were accompliſhed in their Brethren that are in the world.</hi>

                  <p>Followeth the laſt part of the Chapter, which is the Concluſion of the whole Epiſtle, containing ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. In the firſt, the Apoſtle betakes himſelf to God by prayer for theſe ſuffering Chriſtians, that the begun work of grace in them might be carried on to perfection; and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105751:122"/>
for that end, that they might be eſtabliſhed in what they had already attained, that their ſpiritual ſtrength for all their duties and difficulties, might be renewed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and their union with Chriſt the foundation made more and more firm (which is the ſignification of theſe ſeveral expreſſions in the Apoſtle's petition) and for the ſtrengthening of his faith, and theirs: concerning the hearing of this prayer he takes hold of the alſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of grace which is in God, and makes uſe of the ſweet proof thereof, which they had already received in the Lord's calling of them by the Goſpel to the poſſeſſion of his everlaſting bleſſedneſſe through the Mediatour, after they had wreſtled a little while through a few dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in the way to it. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt ought not to ſatisfie themſelves with the preſſing of pertinent duties upon the Lord's People, and holding forth fitting encouragements to be made uſe of by them, that thereby people may come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and approbation of their doctrine; but they muſt alſo by prayer and faith put over upon the Lord to work in the people what they have preſſed, and muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them to the Fountain of furniture, that ſo the people may apprehend a neceſſity of divine influence to concur with mens beſt gifts in order to their profiting, without which neither Miniſters pains, nor peoples reſolutions or endeavours, can have ſucceſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>6. for, ſo doth the Apoſtle here put over upon the Lord by prayer to work in the people that which was his main ſcope in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing to them, <hi>But the God of all grace, &amp;c. make you perfect, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It may be a great comfort to the Lord's People, and encouragement in their duty, when the Lord ſends them ſuch Meſſengers, as have not only ability to clear their duty, and hold forth their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to them, but ſuch as have alſo skill of wreſtling in prayer with God for them, to draw down the bleſſing upon their doctrine, and by their practice of that duty of prayer before the Lord's People, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in the right manner of going about it: for, this
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:105751:123"/>
may be taken for a ſweeet encouragement to them to ſtudy the duties he had preſt upon them, that they had the Apoſtle, ſo earneſt and skilful a wreſtler with God for them, putting up, as it were, in their hearing ſuch pertinent petitions on their behalf, and making uſe of ſuch ſtrong grounds of confidence, as was fitting for the ſtrengthening of their faith and his, that he ſhould be heard, <hi>The God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory by Jeſus Chriſt, after ye have ſuffered a while, make you perfect, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Even thoſe of the Lord's People, who are furtheſt advanced in grace, are far ſhort of that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of perfection which is attainable; they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a member out of joynt, (as the firſt expreſſion here in the Apoſtle's prayer ſignifies) both in regard of their own inward diſtempers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.14. and of their diviſions among themſelves; for healing whereof, <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth the ſame word in his exhortation to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 13.11. they are not ſo hardened againſt, nor reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute as they ought to be to meet with further difficulties, as the next expreſſion in his prayer imports; They are far from that vigour, and ability for their duties and croſſes, and from that cloſe adherence to Chriſt the Foundation-ſtone, (as the two laſt expreſſions import) that they might be at: Of all which defects, every one that deſires to thrive in grace, would labour to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that ſo they may be humble, and ſtirred up to greater progreſſe: for which cauſe, the Apoſtle maketh uſe of ſuch expreſſions in his petitions, as might repreſent to the minds of the people (of whoſe progreſſe he had ſpoken much before) their ſeveral defects, <hi>The God of all grace make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you.</hi> 4. It ought to be the great aim and deſign of Miniſters, in all their labours with God, and with the people, That thoſe who have attained to ſome good meaſure of grace, may not reſt ſatisfied with the ſame, But may be ſtirred up to aim at progreſſe and perfection therein: and for that end may have their inward diſtempers and mutual diviſions healed, as a broken member is ſet in joynt again, that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:105751:123"/>
they may be made able for their duties, and hardened againſt their trials; and that they may be better built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foundation Chriſt, by a more hearty imbracing of his offered Grace, and firm adherance to his Truth: for, theſe are the things which the Apoſtle hath aimed at in his writing this Epiſtle to theſe perſecuted <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in his prayer to God for them, as is clear by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the words in the Original, <hi>The God of all grace make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you.</hi> 5. There is in God an Alſufficiency of every grace, and withall, a ſtrong propenſion to communicate the ſame freely to unworthy ſinners, the conſideration whereof ſhould hearten both Miniſters and People to pray for, and expect a more plentiful meaſure thereof, than what they have already received: for, this firſt ground of confidence, which the Apoſtle makes uſe of, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his own and the peoples faith for obtaining of what he ſeeks here, includeth both the abundance of grace that is in God, and his gracious inclination to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the ſame freely; in both which reſpects he is here called, <hi>The God of all grace.</hi> 6. Whether the Lord's People conſider that woful caſe out of which they are called by the Goſpel, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. or that bleſſed ſtate to which they are called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. they may take his calling of them for a ſure ground to their faith (if ſo be they have conſented to his call) concerning his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to give them every thing neceſſary for their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, till they come to the poſſeſſion of what he hath called them to: for, this is a ſecond ground of confidence which the Apoſtle makes uſe of to obtain what he ſeeks, hereby teaching the people to make uſe of the ſame, <hi>That God had called them unto his eternal glory.</hi> 7. The bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which the Goſpel calleth ſinners to poſſeſſe, is ſuch, as they that obey the Call, can never be put from the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it; Yea, it is of the ſame kind with that which the Lord himſelf liveth in, <hi>glorious for ever,</hi> So that they ſhare with Him of his own bleſſedneſſe, ſo far as they are capable, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.22. for, that bleſſedneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:105751:124"/>
ſinners are called by the Goſpel, is here called, <hi>His eternal glory.</hi> 8. It is by Jeſus Chriſt the Mediatour, that ſinners are called to the poſſeſſion of this eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; He by his bloud hath purchaſed it for them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. by His Word and Spirit doth clear to them the way to it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. Yea, He himſelf is the way, and quickeneth His Redeemed Ones to walk in it, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.6. for, <hi>we are called to his eternal glory by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 9. The way to eternal glory lieth through ſufferings, ſo that none have ground to expect it any other way: for, this clauſe, <hi>after ye have ſuffered,</hi> may be knit to the words going before, <hi>who hath called us into his eternal glory by Jeſus Chriſt, after ye have ſuffered.</hi> 10. Thoſe who get grace to adventure upon ſufferings for Chriſt and His Truth, with the ſmall meaſure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

by all, as their Soveraign Lord unto all eternity; and by his ſo doing, expreſſeth his faith of being heard in his former petitions, that ſo the people for whom he prayed might with the like confidence joyn with him in the ſong. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt's Miniſters ſhould carry a praiſing diſpoſition in their hearts all-along their work, and be ready frequently to break forth in ſome expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof before the Lord's People, eſpecially in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering time: for, the Apoſtle raiſed one long of praiſe at the beginning of this Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. another, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.11. and here in the Concluſion takes it up again, <hi>To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</hi> 2. While the Lords People are praying for a further meaſure of his grace, they ſhould joyn praiſe therewith, acknowledging Him to be glorious in Himſelf, and worthy of all glory from others, to have dominion over all, and wiſhing that His glory may be ſeen and acknowledged, and His dominion ſubmitted unto, in teſtimony of their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for that meaſure of His grace which they have already received, and of their confidence grounded upon their knowledge of His gracious Nature, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experience of His Grace already beſtowed upon them: for, upon theſe grounds, the Apoſtle, having prayed for the Peoples perſeverance, ſtability and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, doth here praiſe, and lead them ſo to do: <hi>To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</hi> 3. When ever the Lords People ſee aright how gracious the Lord is, and hath manifeſted Himſelf to be, in the offers of his Grace to them in the Goſpel, they cannot but have their hearts raiſed to glorifie Him, and to wiſh that many might be ſubject to Him: for, the Apoſtle, having ſet forth the Lord, as the God of all Grace, who had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly called ſinners to partake of his own eternal glory, doth now break forth in praiſe, as that wherein all, that were ſenſible of what he had ſaid, could not but joyn with him; <hi>To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</hi> 4. Where there is a real and kindly deſire of aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing glory and dominion to the Lord, it will extend it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:105751:125"/>
ſelf beyond all time and ages, even toward the length of eternity; conſidering, that His love, and the proofs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will follow His own that length; and that His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and the worth of His favours beſtowed upon His People are ſuch, as unto all eternity they will not be able ſufficiently to acknowledge; and therefore will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that <hi>Glory and Dominion may be given to Him for ever and ever.</hi> 5. While we aſcribe glory and dominion to the Lord, there ſhould be in our hearts ſtrong deſires, that His glory may be known and acknowledged, His dominion enlarged and ſubmitted unto, and much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that it ſhall be ſo, He having engaged his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for that effect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.23. for, this word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both prayer and praiſe uſeth to be cloſed, ſignifies both deſire and confidence, <hi>Amen.</hi>

It becomes thoſe who are of longer ſtanding and more eminent gifts in the Miniſtery, to be ſo far from undervaluing or ſlighting thoſe who are of ſhorter ſtanding and meaner gifts, that they ought to gain to them all the reſpect and eſteem they can, among the Lord's people, for the Meſſage-ſake which they carry: for, this Apoſtle, being among the firſt of thoſe that Chriſt called immediately to the ſervice of the Goſpel, and eminently honoured by him, to be a Pen-man of Scripture, doth here commend <hi>Silvanus</hi> (of whom there was no mention in Chriſt's dayes, and who was only an ordinary Miniſter, called to expound the written Word) as if he had been in all reſpects his equal, <hi>By Silvanus a faithful Brother.</hi> 3. It is the great commendation of a Miniſter of Chriſt, that he be faithful in his Maſter's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by improving his talents, whether moe or fewer, for His glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21, 23. and that he have a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection toward his fellow-labourers, expreſſing the ſame by working to their hands in the work of the Goſpel, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.11. and to the people, by a humble and affectionate care of their good, as if they were his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.1. for, this is the commendation of <hi>Silva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, A faithful Brother to you.</hi> 4. It is neither ſafe to withhold our teſtimony concerning the fidelity of others, when we have grounds for charity, that they do deſerve it, nor to be poſitive and ſuperlative in commending of any, as if we were infallibly perſwaded of their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for, the Apoſtle giveth this commendation to <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus</hi> of his faithfulneſſe, with ſuch an adjection as ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a judgment of charity concerning him, which the Apoſtle had gathered by ſeveral probable grounds and reaſons; and yet the expreſſion doth import an inferiour degree of certainty, to that which he had concerning his own eſtate and fidelity in his Calling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>By Silvanus a faithful Brother, as I ſuppoſe.</hi> 5. It is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:105751:126"/>
a neceſſary favour to the Church and People of God, to have the mind of God given unto them in writing, to be a ſtanding Rule for trial of every thing that is pretended to be His mind, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. to help their frail memories the better to remember His Truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.8. to prevent miſtakes among His People concerning His mind, which would far more readily ariſe, if it had been only delivered in ſo tranſient a way as Satan's oracles are; and that His People, when they have not occaſion to hear His Mind preached or ſpoken by others, may have it with them to read and meditate upon, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.28. for, though this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and others, had preached the ſubſtance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is a commendable thing in Chriſt's Servants, and a ſpecial gift of God's to them, to be able to deliver much of the Lords Mind to His People in a few words, providing it be with plainneſs of ſpeech, So will people be the more able to comprehend in their judgment, and retain in their memory, what is delivered to them: for, the Apoſtle commends this Epiſtle, which hath in it the heads of all ſaving Truths, delivered in much plainneſſe of ſpeech, from the ſhortneſſe of it; <hi>I have written unto you briefly.</hi> 7. It is neceſſary for Chriſts Miniſters to make uſe of ſeveral ſtrains of Doctrine, in dealing with people, ſometimes to exhort them, and that with much earneſtneſſe and vehemency to their duty, ſometimes to comfort them againſt diſcouragements in the way of their duty; both which are in the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt word <hi>Exhorting:</hi> at other times again, to bear witneſſe to the Truths they deliver, as a thing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves know experimentally, and believe to be the Truth of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.11. confirming the ſame from other places of Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.22. and 28.23. and teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them that reject or diſobey the ſame, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:105751:127"/>
the Circumciſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.7. hath gone to viſit, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a viſible Church. And next he delivers commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations from <hi>Mark,</hi> who was a publick Miniſter of the Goſpel, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.10, 11. and being one of this Apoſtle's old acquaintance, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.12. hath been inſtructed by him in the Goſpel, for which he is here called his ſon, as <hi>Timothy</hi> is called <hi>Paul's</hi> for the ſame reaſon, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of the Lord's People (eſpecially in a ſuffering time) though never ſo far diſtant in place, to love and remember one another as if they were preſent, and embracing one another, as the word of ſaluting in the Original imports, to ſignifie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to know one anothers condition, their ſympathy with one anothers ſuffering, and joy for one anothers welfare: all which is imported in the ſalutation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.25. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.10. And it is likewiſe the duty of thoſe who are intruſted with the carrying of ſuch ſalutations, to make conſcience of the delivery of them: for, the Church at <hi>Babylon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereth their diſperſed Countrymen, and deſireth the Apoſtle to ſignifie the ſame to them, who doth it here accordingly: <hi>The Church which is at Babylon ſaluteth you.</hi> 2. The Lord who reigneth in the midſt of His enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. can erect and keep up a Church to himſelf, even in thoſe places of the world where His enemies are permitted to have all the external power in their hand: for, He hath here <hi>a Church at Babylon,</hi> where we never read that the civil-power was imployed for Him. 3. The Lord hath many deſigns of providence, which will not appear for a long time after He hath begun to work in order to the execution of them: for, now it appears that when the <hi>Jews</hi> were carried captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Lord hath had a deſign to have a Goſpel-church erected there before they ſhould all come back again, as is clear by comparing <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. with this, that there is <hi>a Church at Babylon.</hi> 4. The Lord can make the ſinful failings of His People, ſubſervient to His gracious purpoſes, and yet be holy in all His wayes: for, the ſinfull ſtay of ſome
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:105751:127"/>
of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> when they had a call and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to return in <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s time, is made to ſerve the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this holy purpoſe of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anent the having of a viſible Goſpel-Church <hi>at Babylon.</hi> 5. The conſtancy of ſome of the Lords People, who are under the power of wicked men, and the appearance of the grace of Chriſt in them, eſpecially their love, and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with the reſt of His People, ought to move others to conſtancy under their ſufferings, and make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the ſame thorow-bearing ſtrength: for, that the Apoſtle may encourage theſe ſuffering-Believers, to whom he writeth, he ſendeth them here commendations from their Bretheen in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in teſtimony of their love to, and ſympathy with them; <hi>The Church which is at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon ſaluteth you.</hi> 6. No journey never ſo long or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous ought to be ſhunned by any Servant of Chriſt, to do ſervice to Him, who hath engaged Himſelf to be with them go whither they will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. In the faith whereof, <hi>Peter</hi> hath undertaken this long and hazardous journey from <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> from whence he ſendeth this Epiſtle to the reſt of the Chriſtian <hi>Jews.</hi> 7. Becauſe all the Members of the viſible Church are choſen out of the world, to profeſſe Chriſt, and to have the offers of His grace made to them; and ſo many of them as do really imbrace theſe offers, have doubtleſſe been from eternity choſen to be equal ſharers of ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mercies, Therefore they may be all ſpoken of, and dealt with by Chriſt's Miniſters, as <hi>the Elect of God:</hi> for, ſo doth the Apoſtle here ſpeak of the whole viſible Churches, at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and other places, <hi>Elected together.</hi> 8. It is a ſpecial comfort to ſuffering-Chriſtians, to know themſelves remembred and reſpected by more eminent Chriſtians than themſelves, by whom they are apt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend themſelves forgotten and ſlighted: for which cauſe we may ſafely conceive the Apoſtle here to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commendations particularly from <hi>Marcus his ſon.</hi> 9. Thoſe who have been inſtrumental in the converſion or ſpiritual edification of others, ought to entertain a
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:105751:128"/>
ſpecial meaſure of tender affection toward them, and ſhould have from them a ſpecial meaſure of reverence and love, ſuch as children owe to their parents: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Mark</hi> was inſtructed by this Apoſtle, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt and the Goſpel, and did reſemble him in faith and converſation, he is here called <hi>his ſon.</hi> 10. A penitent's former failings ought not to hinder his eſteem with any of the Lords People: for, <hi>Mark,</hi> who by his ſeparating from the Apoſtles while they were about the Work of the Lord, did occaſion a ſinful ſeparation of one of them from another, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.37, 38, 39. is here particularly mentioned, as one dear to this Apoſtle, and whoſe love and remembrance ſhould be a comfort to ſufferers; <hi>And Marcus my ſon.</hi> 11. So careful ſhould the Miniſters of Chriſt be to entertain love among the Lords People, and particularly to beget and cheriſh in their hearts, a good eſteem of other Miniſters, though inferiour to themſelves, that they ſhould willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to be ſervants in the meaneſt offices of love, that may conduce for that end; Therefore doth this great Apoſtle regiſtrate in his Epiſtle the commendations of <hi>the Church at Babylon, and Marcus his ſon.</hi>

It doth much contribute for the ſucceſſe of the Goſpel among a people, that there be mutual love amongſt them, and expreſſions thereof: Therefore the Apoſtles do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily cloſe their Epiſtles with exhortations to mutual love and unity, as that without which, the fruit of their pains in theſe Writings would be much hindered; and ſo doth the Apoſtle here, <hi>Greet ye one another with a kiſſe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:105751:128"/>
2. Whatever decent expreſſions of mutual reſpect and love be the ordinary cuſtom of the times and places where the Lord's People live, they ought not to be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled at, but rather made conſcience of by them, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Him, who commandeth love and reſpect, and conſequently the expreſſions thereof, to be among His People; <hi>Greet one another with a kiſſe of charity.</hi> 3. All the mutual expreſſions of love and reſpect among the Lord's People, ought to flow from an inward affection of chriſtian love in the heart of one of them towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ought not to be performed as faſhional and flattering compliments, which are hateful to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.2, 3. for, ſo the Apoſtle exhorteth, <hi>Greet ye one another with a kiſſe of charity.</hi> 4. The occaſion of frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and correſpondence among the Lords People ought not to diminiſh their love or hinder the expreſſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but rather to encreaſe the ſame; they who live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether being more ready to offend, or miſtake one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo to be mutually jealous of the alienation of one anothers affection, than thoſe who are at a greater diſtance, whoſe love ſhould provoke thoſe that are nearer: for, the Apoſtle, having ſignified the love of thoſe that were at <hi>Babylon</hi> to their diſperſed Brethren, doth here exhort them that had more frequent occaſion of meeting and correſpondence, to <hi>greet one another with a kiſs of charity.</hi> 5. As it is the duty of Chriſt's Miniſters heartily to wiſh all ſort of true peace upon all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church, who, in regard of their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſion, and participation of common gifts and benefits from Chriſt, may be ſaid to be in Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. So true ſpiritual peace, which is the calmneſſe and contentment of the ſoul, ariſing from the faith of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God through Chriſt, when fears of His wrath, and jealouſies of His love, are in ſome meaſure baniſhed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. together with as much outward peace and proſperity, as ſhall be for their true good, is the Lords allowance only to real Believers, and to all of them whether weaker or ſtronger, and may be in a good
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:105751:129"/>
meaſure attained unto, in the midſt of many troubles, by thoſe who are chaſed out of themſelves, and by faith planted in the living Vine, Chriſt Jeſus: for, as this Apoſtolick-benediction may be underſtood of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's wiſh to all the Members of the viſible Church, So it doth eſpecially reſpect true Believers therein; <hi>Peace be to all them that are in Christ Jeſus.</hi> 6. As it is the duty of Chriſt's Miniſters, to preſſe duties upon all Profeſſors; So it is their part to guard promiſes and priviledges, by qualifying the perſons to whom they do belong: for, the Apoſtle, having preſt the duties of love, and expreſſions thereof, upon all indefinitly, to whom he writeth, in the firſt part of this Verſe, he doth in the latter part reſtrict his wiſh of <hi>Peace,</hi> qualifying the perſons to whom it doth eſpecially belong, <hi>Peace be to all them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 7.

                  <p>THe Apoſtle deſcribeth himſelf, 1. from two names, which deſign his perſon. <hi>Simon,</hi> his old name, when he was a fiſher; <hi>Peter,</hi> his new ſurname, given him when Chriſt called him, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.16. and 3.16. The one minding him of his former ignorant and mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the other, of the honour Chriſt put upon him, when He made him a lively ſtone in the Church, and a Believer, and Preacher of that Truth, upon which, as a Rock, He buildeth His Church; which is Chriſt's own expoſition of the name <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16.18. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> It is very neceſſary to carry to the end of our time with us, the ſenſible remembrance of what we were before Chriſt did manifeſt himſelf to us, and of what His grace hath made us, that we may go to Heaven both humble, and thankful: Therefore the Apoſtle ſetteth down theſe two names here in the beginning of his Teſtament, <hi>Simon Peter.</hi> Next, he deſcribeth himſelf from two ſtiles, which deſign his office; the one common to all the Officers of the Church, the other proper to thoſe who had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Commiſſion, and extraordinary Aſſiſtance from Chriſt, to publiſh the Goſpel, and work Miracles. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is honour enough for the higheſt Office-bearer in the Church, to be a Servant of Chriſt; ſo doth this Apoſtle eſteem it, who never called himſelf, Lord, or Head of the Church; but diſcharged it in all Miniſters, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. and here taketh a lower title to himſelf, <hi>A Servant.</hi> 2. It is neceſſary for Chriſt's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to know and aſſert their Calling from Him, that Truth may have weight with People, and they may have courage, what-ever their faithfulneſſe may coſt them: for, while the Apoſtle knoweth himſelf to be a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, he dare avow himſelf by name

He deſcribeth theſe, to whom the Epiſtle is mainly directed, from the worth of their faith, equal to the faith of the Apoſtles, for all ſaving effects; and cleareth the way how they came by it, to wit, by the vertue of the faithfulnes of God, and the merits of Chriſt. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Scriptures are not only given for converting ſinners, and working grace where it is not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. But alſo for their ſake who are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and gracious; fine places being mainly intended for them, to further their growth, guard them againſt temptations, and to fit them for their laſt meeting with Chriſt; which are the ends of this Epiſtle, directed mainly to them <hi>that have obtained precious faith.</hi> 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome Believers are more ſtrong in believing, and ſo have more joy and peace than others, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13, 14. Yet is the faith of them all of alike worth, in ſo far as it uniteth them all to the ſame Saviour, from whom the weakeſt faith ſhall never ſhed; intereſteth them all in the ſame ſpiritual promiſes, priviledges, and glorious reward, and is bought for them all with the ſame price: in all which reſpects, the true faith of the meaneſt Believer is <hi>alike precious</hi> with the faith of the Apoſtles. 3. The way how ſaving faith cometh to the Elect, and is wrought in their hearts, is, by vertue of the faithfulneſſe of God, who promiſed to Chriſt, in the Covenant of Redemption, the beſtowing of it upon the Elect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. and to the Elect in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. It being God's righteouſneſſe to prove himſelf faithfull in making all theſe promiſes; and it comes alſo through Chriſt's righteouſneſſe, which is his doing and ſuffering to purchaſe it, and other ſaving graces for us; and ſo, although we have it freely, Yet Chriſt bought it dear, and God is righteous in giving what Himſelf promiſed, and Chriſt paid for, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. So the Apoſtle makes this precious faith to come to all that have it, <hi>through the righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

The ſeen beginnings of a ſaving work of grace, are comfortable pledges and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations to faith, that that work ſhall thrive, it being ſuitable to the Lords wiſdom, power and conſtancy, to carry on and perfect what He hath begun: for, the Apoſtle wiſheth grace and peace to be multiplied, <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as His divine power had begun the work.</hi> 2. To give grace to a graceleſs ſoul, is a work of Gods infinit power, there being ſo much unworthineſſe, guiltineſſe, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to hinder that work in all the Elect: Therefore the cauſe of this work is here made <hi>divine power.</hi> 3. The Lord in the beſtowing of ſaving grace, worketh both ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtably and freely; neither can any for whom it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and purchaſed, ſo oppoſe, as to hinder the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of it; for, it is <hi>divine power</hi> that worketh it: Nor can any in nature ſo uſe their naturals, as to prepare themſelves for, or merit the beſtowing of it: for, <hi>divine power</hi> worketh, by giving freely all things that pertain to life, and ſo the very preparations for the new life. 4. The ſubſtance of every ſaving grace, though not the full meaſure, and a right to what may enable for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God in practice, is given at once in converſion; As a Child, when it firſt liveth, or is new born, hath all the eſſential parts of a man: Therfore to theſe, to whom the Apoſtle wiſheth encreaſe of grace, and upon whom he is to preſſe growth, he affirmeth to be already given <hi>all things that pertain to life and godlineſs.</hi> 5. The very firſt beginnings of grace is wrought in the heart, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſinner drink-in the knowledge of Chriſt: the Law indeed prepares for this work, by diſcovering ſin and deſerved wrath, and terrifying the conſcience; But the

Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the Promiſes of the new Covenant are beyond all expreſſion great and precious, becauſe of the ſpiritual and eternal riches which they do contain, and will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore highly eſteemed and commended by all that have faith to imbrace the gift of them; So the way how the Lord worketh ſaving grace at firſt, is by making out theſe Promiſes, enabling the guilty, graceleſſe and curſed

The receiving of theſe Promiſes by faith, maketh a wonderfull change upon ſinners: for, ſo ſoon as a ſinner getteth grace to believe and apply the free promiſes of the Covenant, as ſoon doth the Lord begin to make out upon his heart the things promiſed, ſo ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it with His own Image, that the ſinner receiving theſe Promiſes, beginneth preſently to look like God his Father, and in ſome weak meaſure, to reſemble Him, in heavenly wiſdom, holineſſe, uprightneſſe, and other of His communicable properties, eſpecially in humility, ſelf-denial, love and pity toward other miſerable ſinners, zeal for the Lords honour, and ſuch other perfections as were eminent in the Man Chriſt; and this is <hi>to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the divine nature.</hi> This change kythes alſo, in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring and flying from the filthie faſhions which flow from the unmortified corruption of theſe that are yet living in nature, and ſo eſchewing the wrath and ruine which ſuch are liable to; both which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by <hi>eſcaping the corruption which is in the world through luſt;</hi> and is here made the effect of receiving the Promiſes: and where this work is, it proveth a right to the Covenant, and giveth ground of confidence, that that work ſhall grow.

Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Even they who diſcern in themſelves a ſaving work of grace, and know the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges ſpoken of before, to be theirs, are not now to ſit down idle, and ſatisfied, but to be the more active and diligent in the exerciſe of grace and holy duties: for, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Beſides this</hi> (that ye have precious faith and promiſes, and do partake of the divine nature) <hi>give all diligence.</hi> 2. As it is not that ordinary diligence, wherewith moſt Profeſſors ſatisfie themſelves, that will be bleſt to make a thriving Chriſtian; but, ſuch as goeth through all means, and waiteth upon all opportunities of profiting, that their ability and calling will permit them to follow; and gets the flower of a Chriſtians wit, affections, and time, which is here called, <hi>all diligence;</hi> So, a Chriſtian's end in being thus diligent, muſt not be his own credit before others, or the ſatisfaction of his conſcience only, But that the exerciſe and fruits of one grace may be ſtill added to another, and ſo Chriſt may be honoured in him, and by him; <hi>Giving all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, adde to your faith, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Saving faith which gripeth Chriſt for pardon and ſtrength, and daily flyeth to Him for both, muſt be holden faſt and renewed in the exerciſe of it, by all that would thrive in any other grace, or be fit for any duty; if either we looſe the grips of faith, or do not frequently renew them, we can thrive in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: therefore is faith here made the firſt ſtone in this ſpiritual building, to which all the reſt are to be added; <hi>Add to your faith, &amp;c.</hi> 4. With the maintaining and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the acts of ſaving faith, a Chriſtian that would grow, muſt ſo mind his duty, as that he keep himſelf in the neareſt diſpoſition for it: for, no leſſe is ſignified by <hi>vertue,</hi> than the working habit of every grace, which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:105751:134"/>
keepeth a Chriſtian in ſuch a fitneſſe for doing or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when he is called to them, either of them are lovely to him, and he is in ſome meaſure ready for them; which the Scripture calleth elſewhere, the having of the heart at the right-hand, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.2. and ſtanding with the loyns girt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14. and here is called <hi>Adding to faith, vertue.</hi> 5. There is more than this readineſſe of diſpoſition for duty, requiſit to make a growing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, even the uſe of holy reaſon to time and mannage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wiſely, that as the heart lieth to duty, there may be skill to go about it with prudence and circumſpection, as the word, <hi>knowledge,</hi> here ſignifieth, which is to be <hi>added to vertue.</hi> 6. Becauſe there remaineth in the beſt many immoderate and unruly affections and paſſions, which, as they are ready to exceed bounds, even about lawfull objects, ſo the exceſſe of them doth darken reaſon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe the heart for duty, mar the exerciſe of faith, and ſo hinder all the former three; Therefore, a Chriſtian that would grow, muſt labour to have, by the power of God's grace in him, ſuch a command over his paſſions of anger fear, grief, &amp;c. and over his affections of love, joy, and the like, eſpecially in the uſe of ſenſual delights, that he may be able to keep them within the bounds, which right reaſon, according to the Rules of God's Word, doth preſcribe to them. Therefore, the Apoſtle exhorteth to <hi>adde to knowledge, temperance;</hi> which is a grace whereby a Chriſtian's paſſions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are held under the dominion of ſanctified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 7. Becauſe all that walk in this way may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect trials and croſſes in it, Therefore muſt a Chriſtian that would grow, labour for a rational and willing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to theſe, knowing, that he deſerveth worſe, that they may come from love, and work together for his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal good, upon which Scripture-grounds Believers Chriſtian-<hi>patience</hi> is built, which is here to be added to the former. 8.

A thriving Chriſtian muſt with his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe make conſcience of duties to his neighbour, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, of entertaining a kindly and tender affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all, whom he is bound in charity to eſteem Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſame Father with himſelf, and kyth this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to weak and ſtrong, by ſympathizing with them in trouble, ſupplying their neceſſities, edifying their ſouls, and every way ſtudying to promote their ſpiritual and temporal welfare, according to his place and ability, which is to <hi>adde to godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs.</hi> 10. The duties of love are not to be all confined to the Saints on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, But if we would prove our ſelves growing Chriſtians, we muſt thirſt after, and endeavour the true good of the ſouls and bodies of all to whom our prayers or pains may be profitable, within the compaſſe of our calling, which is to <hi>adde to brotherly kindneſſe, charity,</hi> a grace, the exerciſe whereof, the Scripture preſſeth upon Chriſtians in reference to all men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.12.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe even thoſe who are endued with theſe graces, are ready to become lazie and too contented with their meaſure; Therefore the Apoſtle, to the 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> doth by many moving arguments, labour to rouſe them up to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and the ſtudy of growth. The firſt motive is from the advantage thereof, That the Chriſtian in whom theſe graces are, and are in lively exerciſe and growth, ſhall never be without work, as the word here tranſlated, <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> doth properly ſignifie; nor ſhall his work be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch fruits as ſhall manifeſt, for his own comfort and

God's honour &amp; the good of others, that he doth ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, and hath an intereſt in, Jeſus Chriſt, as his own Lord; Therefore the growth, and exerciſe of grace, is much to be ſtudied. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The moſt unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable duties had need to be preſt upon Chriſtians by many arguments: for, what we do moſt eaſily aſſent to in judgment, we are oftentimes moſt careleſſe of in practice: Therefore doth the Apoſtle in this following part of the Chapter, multiply motives, to preſſe this one clear duty, That gracious perſons ought to ſtudy growth in grace. 2. Even theſe of whom the beſt in the world, may be charitable that they are gracious, ought, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, to put themſelves to the trial, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth, and growth of their graces; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even theſe, who are before ſpoken to, as having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious faith and other graces, are here put to try, <hi>if theſe things be in them, and abound.</hi> 3. Though the grace of ſanctification be in, and from Chriſt, as the treaſure and fountain thereof, yet it is really inherent in the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as the ſubject. It is not ſufficient to believe, that there is abundance of grace in Chriſt; but we muſt try, and labour to ſee, <hi>if theſe things be in us</hi> from Chriſt. 4. It is a ſafe and approven way, to try the reality and growth of grace by the effects thereof, to wit, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's activity in commanded duties, and his fruitfulneſs in his converſation, for the honour of Chriſt, and the good of others: for, here the Apoſtle putteth them to try, <hi>if theſe things be in them, and abounding,</hi> which he ſaith <hi>they will know by the effects of them, They make you that ye ſhall neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> 5. As grace may be in the habits and ſeeds of it, where it is not lively and growing; So it is not the being of it in us, but the livelineſſe and growth of it that makes a Chriſtian buſie, and bear the fruits of chearful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt's Commands, edifying and ſupplying others, and the like; which fruits will kyth in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, where grace is, and is in vigour, and will evidence a ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, and intereſt in Him: for,

                  <p>The ſecond motive to diligence and growth in grace, is taken from the hazard of the want, or decay of theſe graces. Thoſe that are altogether void of ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, and the reſt of the graces mentioned, are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly blind in all things ſpiritual, and cannot be taken up with any thing beyond this preſent world, and ſo doth declare that they undervalue that great priviledge, the forgiveneſſe of ſins, which by their Baptiſm and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they did ſeem, and were eſteemed to have; Yea, and even thoſe, in whom theſe graces really are, but are under a decay and without exerciſe, they are ſo far blind in things ſpiritual, and intent upon things worldly, that they do, for the time, walk as if they had forgotten their pardon: Concerning both which, the Apoſtle's argument may be underſtood, and hath force to move all to diligence, and the ſtudy of growth in grace. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. How ſharp-ſighted ſoever graceleſſe ſouls may be in things that concern their back and belly, and this preſent world; Yet, till Chriſt make a gracious change upon them, they can ſee nothing of the hazard of their periſhing, the worth of ſalvation, or their need of Chriſt, that they might fly to Him, and give up themſelves to His ſervice, and ſo make preparation for death and eternity; <hi>For he that lacketh theſe things is blind, and cannot ſee afa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

While folks are of this temper and way, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be eſteemed pardoned ſouls by themſelves, and others, and dealt with by the Church as if they were ſuch, Yet by their being wholly taken up with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, and making no proviſion for a better, they do declare that they undervalue the forgiveneſſe of ſins <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

when the eſteem of forgiveneſſe doth not ſtir up to thankfulneſſe and holineſſe, God eſteemeth it forgotten; And he that walketh, as if he forgot himſelf to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, cannot comfortably conclude himſelf to be ſuch a one, however he may be eſteemed and ſpoken of by the beſt, <hi>as one that hath been purged from his old ſins.</hi> 3. As ſins once committed, ought ſtill to be eſteemed old, as rags that are caſt off, or vomits never to be licked up again; So all that either are, or do profeſſe, or eſteem themſelves to be pardoned, ought to keep the ſenſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Lord's pardoning mercy ſo freſh in their hearts, as they may be daily renewing their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for their old ſins, their thankfulneſs for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, and watchfulneſs againſt the like; the lack of which lively exerciſes, even in real Believers, proveth them to be much forgetful <hi>that they have been purged from their old ſins.</hi>

                  <p>Followeth the third and fourth motives to diligence and growth in grace. The one is, The more of theſe a Chriſtian attain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto, the more ſhall be his clearneſſe and certainty that he was from eternity choſen to life, and is in time effectually called. The other is, That by this means he ſhall be kept from Apoſtaſie and yeelding to temptations by the way. From the third motive, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although the election and effectual calling of every ſoul fled to Chriſt, can be no ſurer than they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Yet may thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges be very unſure, and unclear to the apprehenſion of theſe that are both choſen and called; Therefore they are here exhorted <hi>to make</hi> them <hi>ſure.</hi> 2. As ſome comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meaſure of the certainty of both may be attained to, even by ordinary Believers; So this jewel of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth not fall in the lap of any lazie ſoul, nor can
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:105751:136"/>
any expect to attain to it, or yet to entertain it, in whoſe hearts grace is without exerciſe, and whoſe converſation is without fruitfulneſſe: for, ſo the Apoſtle exhorteth, to <hi>give all diligence to make</hi> them <hi>ſure;</hi> importing, that without that <hi>diligence</hi> they cannot be made ſure to our hearts. From the fourth motive, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although none that are choſen and called, can finally or totally fall away from grace, Yet are they of themſelves ſubject ſo to do, and may actually fall in foul and ſcandalous ſins for a time; ſo much is ſuppoſed in this argument to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, <hi>If you do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall.</hi> 2. The Lord's way of preſerving His own from falling, is, by helping them to exerciſe their faith, and other graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named, and to entertain ſo much of the fear of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling finally, or ſcandalouſly, as ſtirreth them up to <hi>give all diligence,</hi> that their falling either wayes may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: for, the hazard of falling is here made a motive to ſtir up Believers to diligence and exerciſe of grace.</p>

                  <p>Here is the fifth motive.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>As a ſixth motive, the Apoſtle applieth his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, preſſing growth and diligence to himſelf in his Calling as a Miniſter, That ſince the hazard of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the vantage of diligence was ſo great, as he had cleared, therefore he himſelf would not be negligent in his duty of ſtirring them up to diligence, although he ſuppoſed many of them to be both diſcerning and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Chriſtians, by reaſon whereof they might conceive ſo much preſſing needleſſe. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. While a Miniſter preſſeth duties upon People by arguments, or motives, he ought to apply theſe motives to himſelf, for his own up-ſtirring in the duties of his Calling; So doth the Apoſtle here, while he ſaith, <hi>Wherefore</hi> (to wit, becauſe of the motives, whereby I preſſed diligence upon you) <hi>I will not be negligent.</hi> 2. One kindly motive of a Miniſter's diligence and earneſtneſſe with People, is, the ſenſe he hath of the hazard or benefit may come to ſouls, by ſlighting, or obeying the Truths and Duties preſſed; So is it with the Apoſtle here, as his own hazard, and vantage ſtirreth him up; So his conſideration of their hazard and advantage, maketh him ſtir them up. 3. As it is the duty and commendation of Chriſtians, not to be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:105751:137"/>
ſtill fluctuating and unfixed in matters of opinion, or practice in Religion; So neither the promiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to bring all things to their remembrance, nor Peoples great knowledge and ſetledneſſe in the Truth, doth put them beyond the need of the daily pains of Miniſters, whoſe work is, not only to point out Believers Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and to inform them of what they know not, But to inculcate, clear, and preſſe known Truths and Duties, even upon diſcerning and ſtabliſhed Chriſtians, whoſe imperfection in knowledge, forgetfulneſſe, lazineſſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and oftentimes conceit, that much preſſing of known Truths and Duties is needleſſe, doth require that they ſhould be <hi>put in mind, though they know and be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in theſe things.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The ſeventh motive ſerveth both to ſtir him up to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his place, and theſe to whom he writes, in theirs; and it is taken from the neceſſity of his ſo doing, and that both upon his part, who was bound to it by vertue of his Calling, as long as he had life with ability; and upon their part, who ſtood in need, not only to be minded of their duty, but to be powerfully rouſed (as the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth) to the practice of it. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is neither the credit nor profit of a Miniſters Calling that ſhould move him to painfulneſſe, but rather the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the equity of the work, how juſt a thing it is, as the Apoſtle's word here ſignifieth, that one ſo unworthy of ſo honourable an Imployment, and many times juſtly deſerving to have been thruſt out of it, ſhould yet be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, furniſhed, and rewarded by Jeſus Chriſt: This made the Apoſtle, and ought to make every other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to ſtir up himſelf and others, becauſe he <hi>thinketh it meet,</hi> or, juſt and equitable ſo to do. 2. As death is the term-day of a Miniſter's ſervice in his Calling, till which time he ought neither to deſire to change his Calling, nor
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:105751:138"/>
do it by Deputies under him, though he meet with ſmall ſucceſſe and great hardſhip; So the conſideration of his frail, flitting and fighting condition, imported by being in a <hi>tabernacle,</hi> ſhould make him ſtir himſelf buſily while time and ſtrength laſteth; Therfore the Apoſtle counted it juſt ſo to do <hi>as long as he was in the tabernacle</hi> of his body; and was moved to diligence, by taking up his preſent condition, under the ſimilitude of being in a <hi>tabernacle.</hi> 3. A Miniſter ſhould not content himſelf barely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Truths, and minde people of their duty, but by all means ſhould labour with God, and his own heart, to have ſuch power accompanying his pains, that dead, ſleeping and lazie ſouls, may be quickened, wakened, and rouſed up: for, no leſſe doth this word ſignifie, which the Apoſtle addeth to the word he uſed in the former Verſe, <hi>to ſtir you up, by putting you in remembrance.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>The eighth motive, is taken from the nearneſſe of the Apoſtle's death, Chriſt having told him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.18. that in his old dayes he ſhould be martyred; and now knowing the time to be near, he maketh uſe of the warning, both for his own, and their up-ſtirring. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The nearer our journeys end be, the faſter ſhould we run, according to our ſtrength, in ſerving Chriſt, and doing good to ſouls: for, when death is near, the beſt will think the great part of their buſineſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: Thus the Apoſtle is earneſt with them, becauſe he knew he was ſhortly <hi>to put off his tabernacle.</hi> 2. Learn from this, how hard uſage, and unpleaſant to fleſh and bloud, thoſe who are moſt beloved and honoured of Chriſt, may meet with in the world, even ſuch as this Apoſtle met with, who after much perſecution, frequent ſcourging and impriſonment in his younger dayes, muſt notwithſtanding in old age, when natural vigour is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and men uſe to look for reſt, fall in the hands of cruel
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:105751:138"/>
perſecutors; for, he <hi>muſt put off his tabernacle, as Chriſt ſhewed him.</hi> The reward maketh up all, and the faith thereof can encourage againſt all; And, no doubt, this man, who had denied his Maſter, did account it his greateſt honour to get leave to ſuffer for Him. 3. Though every one be not ſo particularly warned of their perſonal trials, as <hi>Peter</hi> was, Yet all, being commanded to make them for ſufferings, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. ſhould live mindfull thereof, though they be long delayed; and prepare for them, though they be kept off till gray hairs: So the Apoſtle here mindeth, and prepareth for that trial, now in his old age, whereof Chriſt foretold him in his youth. 4. Though it be dangerous to ſlight a Meſſage from the youngeſt Miniſter, fitted for, and lawfully called to, that Work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. So a Meſſage from an aged and perſecuted Servant of Chriſt, who is ſhortly like to be plucked away from people, ſhould have a ſpecial weight with them: for, the Apoſtle maketh this an argument to ſtir them up, <hi>That he was ſhortly to put off his tabernacle, as Chriſt ſhewed him.</hi>

                  <p>The laſt motive, is taken from the Apoſtle's zeal for Chriſt's glory, in ſtudying to propagate His Truth for the good of ſouls; And for that end, reſolveth to take courſe before he died, how the Church might reap profit when he was gone; which he did, by writing Scripture, putting forth and inſtructing faithful Labourers, who did good after him. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The ſenſe of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Jeſus Chriſt, will make His Servants and People, ſincerely ſtudious to do that while they live, that may be ſome way uſefull for His honour and the good of others, when they are gone. And though every one cannot leave ſuch profitable monuments as ſome others have done; Yet ought every Chriſtian endeavour to
<pb facs="tcp:105751:139"/>
leave behind them the ſeeds of ſaving knowledge, ſowen in the hearts of thoſe with whom they converſe, at leaſt, the ſavory remembrance of their humble and holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the fruits of their charity and other good works, which may do as much good after their deceaſe, as ſome Volumns do: Therefore did the Apoſtle, not only ſtir them up, while he was in his tabernacle, but endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to propagate the Truth among them and others, after his deceaſe. 2. As the beſt way of ſerving the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after us, is the ſtudy of tranſmitting pure Truth to them; which the Apoſtle here reſolveth upon: So, the foreſight of approaching trials, doth not abate, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the zeal of the Lord's faithful Servants after His honour, and the good of ſouls; (the death of the Godly, of what ever kind it be, being a perfect outgate (as the word, <hi>deceaſe,</hi> ſignifieth) from all ſin, ſorrow and fears) Therefore doth the Apoſtle, knowing he was ſhortly to be martyred, ſtir up himſelf the more to diligence.</p>

much glory breaking through it, in His Miracles and Transfiguration. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There is as much atheiſm and unbelief natural to all, as to look upon the myſterie of Salvation through Chriſt incarnate, as upon a fable, invented to kyth the quickneſſe of mens wit, and pleaſe the ears of people; ſo much is imported in this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the commendation of the Apoſtles preaching, <hi>We have not followed cunningly deviſed fables.</hi> 2. The main ſubject of the preaching of the Goſpel, is to point out Chriſt's coming in our fleſh, ſuch an errand as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, and Save, and his furniture for that work, which is encouragement enough for every loſt ſinner that hears it, to fly to Him for ſalvation, ſince He is come to ſeek, and ſave ſuch, and hath power to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God through Him: for, this is here made the ſubſtance of the Apoſtle's preaching, <hi>To make known the power and coming of Chriſt.</hi> 3. As Jeſus Chriſt doth not uſe all His Servants alike familiarly in everything, but oftentimes thoſe moſt, whom He mindes to try moſt: So, any ſpecial honour any of them getteth, ſhould never be forgotten, but minded, eſpecially when trials are near, and brought forth, only to commend Chriſt and His Truth, and encourage againſt ſuffering.

                  <p>In the next place, the Apoſtle commendeth Chriſt, as our Cautioner and Mediatour, from the high eſteem He hath with the Father; and from the full ſatisfaction the Father hath with the price of Redemption, paid by Him: of both which the Father gave a publick Declaration, from His glorious reſidence in Heaven, before three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who were with Chriſt upon a Hill where He did manifeſt Himſelf to be God, glorious in holineſſe. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Glory of the Son of God incarnate, was ſo obſcured for our ſake, that He needed a Declaration from Heaven, to ſhew the Father's eſteem of Him, and to beget a high eſteem of Him in the hearts of His own: This is imported in Chriſt's <hi>receiving from the Father, honour and glory,</hi> which was not an addition of any glory to Chriſt, which as God He had not; but a manifeſtation of the glory which He had, but obſcured under the vail of our infirm fleſh. 2. As Glory is ſo excellent a thing, that they that get but a little glimpſe of it, cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, and commend it, as worthy to be contended and ſuffered for, as here the Apoſtle doth: So Chriſt, as our Mediatour, hath not only much Glory given Him, as the fruit of His obedience to the death for ſinners, and a pledge to His Members, that they ſhall ſhare of the Glory of their Head, whereof this upon the Mount, was a little fore-ſight and taſt, given Him for His and His Followers encouragement under ſuffering: But alſo, He is in ſuch power and credit with God the Father, that He can do in Heaven and Earth, what He pleaſeth, for the good of His Redeemed Ones; and nothing can be done without Him. All which is imported in Chriſt,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:105751:140"/>
                     <hi>receiving from the Father honour and glory, by a voice from that Excellent Glory.</hi> 3. God the Father is ſo fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and compleatly paid, by the Mediatour Chriſt, for all that flie to Him for refuge, that He ſeeketh no further mends for all their wrongs, nor further price for what they need, only that they do receive Him freely, as He is freely offered; and that as the Father ſpeaketh down this of Chriſt, to ſinners, <hi>He is my beloved Son, in Him I am well pleaſed; Hear Him,</hi> So ſinners ſhould anſwer back again with their hearts, Chriſt is our beloved Redeemer, in whom we are well pleaſed, Let the Father hear Him for us. 4. It is not eaſie for wakened ſinners, who are oftentimes much unſatisfied with themſelves, to believe, and take comfort from this, That God is well ſatisfied with Chriſt for them: Therefore, though <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wrote this Truth, the Father ſpoke it down from Heaven twice before witneſſes; three Evangeliſts have recorded it, and ſome of them have ſet it down thrice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. and 12.18. and 17.5. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.22. and 9.35. Yet the Apoſtle ſetteth it down here, and to make it take impreſſion, ſaith again, <hi>This voice we heard, when we were with Him.</hi> 5. It is no ſin, nor ſuperſtition, to eſteem, and ſpeak of things, that can have no inherent holineſſe, and may have no religious worſhip, ſo, as may moſt teſtifie our reſpect to His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, who doth manifeſt Himſelf in, or by theſe things; for which cauſe, the very Ground and Houſe where He manifeſteth Himſelf, is called <hi>Holy, Exod.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Iſu.</hi> 64.11. though they can have no more than a relative holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And ſeveral other things, ſuch as the Day for His Service, the written Word, &amp;c. and here the Hill, where the Lord, who is glorious in Holineſſe, did ſhew much of His Glory, is called <hi>The Holy Mount.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>In the third place, the Apoſtle commendeth the whole written Word, 1. from the certainty of it. He calleth it <hi>A Word of Propheſie,</hi> giving to the whole the name of one principal part, moſt of the Old Teſtament being a fore-telling of theſe things concerning the Meſſiah and His Kingdom, which the New cleareth to have their accompliſhment in Him that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and calleth it <hi>A more ſure Word,</hi> comparing it with <hi>the Voice from Heaven,</hi> whereof he ſpoke immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before; not as if there could be any uncertainty in the Lord's Voice ſpeaking from Heaven, but becauſe it is a greater matter, to have fore-ſeen and fore-told things to come, than to have ſeen and related the greateſt things preſent: And becauſe a tranſient Voice is more eaſily miſtaken or forgotten, than a ſtanding authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; therefore, the written Word is a more ſure ground for ſinners faith to reſt upon, than a Voice from Heaven could be. Next, he commendeth the written Word from the uſefulneſſe thereof, that it ſhould prove to ſinners, who make it the rule of their faith and manners, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Directory, through this dark ſtate of ignorance and miſery, until they get ſuch a meaſure of the promiſed Spirit, and nearneſs to the Son of righteouſneſs, that they ſhall not need a proſpect of Glaſſe, of the Word and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which will not be till death and the dawning of the day of eternity. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The written Word, believed to be the Lord's mind, is the ſureſt ground, for faith to reſt upon, of any that ever hath been, or can be, given to ſinners, ſubject to forgetfulneſſe, jealouſies and miſtakes; the general offers of Chriſt, and free promiſes of His grace, excluding none who will not exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, give more ſolid encouragement to ſelf-judging
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:105751:141"/>
ſinners, than they could have by a Voice from Heaven, calling them by their names; for, that would readily be ſuſpected to be another than the Lord's, or ſpoken to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of that name: Therefore, the Apoſtle comparing the written Word, with the Voice from Heaven, calleth it to ſinners, <hi>A more ſure Word.</hi> 2. As this world is ſo dark a place, that our own reaſon, the counſel or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, will often leave us comfortleſſe, to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and fall in ſnares, except we look to the light of the Word, which ſhineth in this dark place: So they have the Lord's approbation and commendation, who do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their hearts to, and ſatisfie themſelves with, this Word, as the only and ſufficient ground of their faith, and rule of their manners, to keep them from erring in judgment or practice; for, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ye do well to take heed, as to a light that ſhineth in a dark place.</hi> 3. Although the light be now clear, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what was before Chriſt came; Yet, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that light we ſhall have in Heaven, it is but dark; Like the light that ſhineth out of a room where a candle is, in a room where the candle is not ſeen: So much doth this ſimilitude of <hi>a light ſhining in a dark place,</hi> import. 4. Though it be ſo, Yet ſhall the Word give comfortable direction to all that follow the light of it, under all their croſſes, confuſions, and difficulties, and theſe who make it a lamp to their feet, and a light to their path, may be ſure to get at laſt ſuch a clear and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ſight of Chriſt, as ſhall baniſh all darkneſſe and doubts; and ſuch a near union and fellowſhip with Him, the bright Morning-Star, gloriouſly preſent by His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in their hearts, and perſonally alſo in humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, converſing with them for ever, that they ſhall have no more need of Word or Ordinances; which is the condition here deſcribed by the Apoſtle, only to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in Heaven, till which time we will never be above the direction of the Word and uſe of the Ordinances, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12.</p>

                  <p>Laſt of all, the Apoſtle commendeth the written Word, from the Divine Authority of it; the interpretation or true meaning whereof, cannot be found out by the wit, or proper invention of any; whereof the Apoſtle giveth a reaſon, Becauſe theſe truly gracious men, who were conſecrated, and ſet a part by the Lord, for receiving and regiſtring His mind in Scriptures, could neither ſpeak nor write, when, nor what things they pleaſed, but as they were immediatly moved, and infallibly furniſhed by the Lord's Spirit, whoſe mind it is; Therefore the Scriptures are of Divine Authority; and this the Apoſtle ſaith, muſt be known firſt, to wit, as a principle of ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without which, Chriſtians cannot profit by the Scriptures.

As it is the duty of all the Lord's People, to fix in their minds, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Truth, this principle, <hi>That the Scriptures being the Lord's mind, none can of themſelves attain to the true meaning of them:</hi> So, till this principle be known, at leaſt ſo far as that it be not queſtioned, there can be no light or comfort expected from the Word: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, having exhorted in the former Verſe, to look to the Word for direction and comfort, doth adde here, that as they would find theſe, they muſt know this firſt, <hi>that it is not of any private interpretation.</hi> And though only the Spirit of the Lord, the Author of the Scriptures, can fully perſwade hearts, that they are His mind; Yet, if men would conſider, that a great many of theſe truths that are revealed in Scripture, are not only agreeable to Natures-light, but may be in ſome meaſure known by it; The one (to wit, the light of Nature) teaching, That there is one God, the firſt cauſe of all, omnipotent, wiſe, righteous and good; that it is reaſonable He ſhould be ſerved, and that according to His own will, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He, being both wiſe and good, muſt have ſome way revealed, that reaſonable creatures have immortal ſouls, and ſo die not as the beaſts; that there is no true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in theſe things, wherein men do ordinarily ſeek it; that ſince vice and vertue, receive not ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards here, there muſt be puniſhment and reward after this life: all which, and many other things of this ſort, Natures-light teacheth, though darkly, as the Scriptures themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. and the Writings of thoſe that never knew the Scriptures, do witneſſe.

               <p>BEcauſe the prevailing of Error doth ordinarily bring with it, a great decay of Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Therefore the Apoſtle, (having in the firſt part of this Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. preſt the ſtudy of growth in grace and diligence in holy duties) doth in this Chapter, which is the ſecond part, guard againſt the infection of error. And for this end, he doth, 1. give fore-warning of the riſe and prevalency of falſe Teachers in the Church of the New Teſtament, eſpecially ſuch as under a pretence of liberty through Jeſus Chriſt, would looſe the reigns to all licentiouſneſſe, as appeareth by comparing the 1. and 19. verſes. 2. He doth at large deſcribe them by ſuch clear characters, taken from their abominable doctrine and vile practices, as might make them known and hateful to all the Lord's People. 3. He doth threaten them with no leſſe terrible judgments than ever had come upon the vileſt ſinners that ever lived, that ſo all might be afraid to drink-in their errors. And, 4. he doth hold out to the Godly ſome grounds of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to be made uſe of by them, for their preſervation

both from their errors and plagues. Theſe four are the principal parts of the Chapter; which are not handled apart, but often intermixed throughout the whole, as will appear by a particular view of the Sum thereof. The Apoſtle forwarneth of the riſe of theſe ſoul-ſeducers, deſcribing them from the ſtrain and tendency of their doctrine, together with the hazard of it to themſelves and their followers, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. from the ſucceſſe they ſhould have, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. from their way of prevailing, and certainty of their judgment, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Which laſt, he confirmeth by a threefold inſtance of God's judgment upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Old World, and <hi>Sodom;</hi> intermixing therewith a twofold example of the Lord's preſerving of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> as pledges of His reſpect to His own in all times of the prevailing of ſin and judgment, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. both which he doth apply for the comfort of the Godly, and terror of the wicked, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. eſpecially of ſuch ſoul-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and their followers, as had given themſelves to the ſervice of their luſts, wherein they were ſo bold and ſelf-pleaſing, that they laboured to diſgrace all lawfull Authority that might oppoſe them, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. which ſin, he aggravates from the carriage of the good Angels who honour Magiſtracie, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And from their likeneſſe to the beaſts, by reaſon of it, in undervaluing that whereof they knew not the worth, and violent proſecuting of their luſts of pleaſure, gain and glory; for which he threatneth that their end ſhall be worſe than the beaſts, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14. And for their Apoſtaſie from the Truth, for gain, and other idols, which they no leſſe violently purſue than <hi>Balaam, ver.</hi> 15. when no oppoſition, even extraordinary, could reſtrain, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. and for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair pretences, whereby they did inſnare poor ſouls, once brought from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19. For all which, eſpecially their Apoſtaſie after ſo great a change externally, he threatneth them and their followers, with more wrath, than if they had never known and profeſſed as they did, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21.

leaveth to their own conſcience to infer. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Yet is the Lord's Juſtice againſt impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners ſo clear, in the examples thereof recorded in Scripture, and the vvitneſſe and deputy conſcience, which God hath in every man's boſom, ſo impartial, that if, upon ſerious conſideration of what God's holy Juſtice hath done to ſinners before, it were put to ſpeak what men, continuing in their ſinful courſes, have to expect now, they could not but be made to apply wrath to themſelves, and certainly to expect it, while they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

                  <p>For the comfort of all that mourn for the prevailing of iniquity in thoſe among whom they live, the Apoſtle ſubjoyneth to the former inſtance, the example of <hi>Lot's</hi> preſervation, whom the Spirit of the Lord, that indited this Scripture, doth commend by ſeveral expreſſions of great reſpect, for His deep reſentment of, and ſympathy with, the Lord's ſuffering honour, and for theſe vile <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites</hi> amongſt whom Providence had caſt his lot for a time. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The deareſt of the Children of the Lord may be put by His providence to have their reſidence among the worſt of men, the Lord thereby correcting and humbling them for their too low eſteem and little uſe-making of better ſociety while they had it; of which fault it ſeems <hi>Lot</hi> was not altogether free, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. and thereby alſo giving them occaſion to do good to the ſouls of their godleſſe neighbours, and bear witneſſe againſt their wickedneſſe: both which, <hi>Lot</hi> endeavoured, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.7. who for theſe, and other reaſons, had his lot among the <hi>Sodomites</hi> for a time. 2. It is not impoſſible for the Children of the Lord, living among the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, to retain their integrity, and have the Lord's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation for their diſpoſition and carriage, there being much more power in the grace of Chriſt, and his indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Spirit in them, than there is in the temptations of Satan, or the example of the wicked, notwithſtanding all their terrors and allurements: for, <hi>Lot</hi> among the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> is approven, and commended as <hi>a juſt and righteous man.</hi> 3. It is the kindly diſpoſition of a true penitent, to be ſo far from taking pleaſure in the ſins of others, as the wicked do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. that he will be vexed in ſoul, and will account it his duty to put himſelf to much greif, as the words here ſignifie, while he doth ponder, and is a witneſſe of His diſhonour that hath forgiven him: for, ſo was it with penitent and pardoned <hi>Lot,</hi> he was <hi>vexed,</hi> (which is a paſſive word) and <hi>did vex,</hi> (which is an active) <hi>his righteous ſoul with the filthy converſation,</hi> and unjuſt deeds <hi>of the Sodomites.</hi> 4. This ſympathizing frame of ſpirit with the Lords ſuffering honour, is much taken notice of by Him, both to reward it graciouſly, and to puniſh them that occaſion that grief to His People; Therefore both the expreſſions of <hi>Lot's</hi> vexation, and of the Lord's reſpect to him, are frequently repeated here, <hi>Juſt Lot was vexed, and did vex his righteous ſoul.</hi> 5. It is the priviledge of a true penitent, to be in no leſſe eſteem with a merciful God, and to find no leſſe expreſſions of reſpect from Him, than if he had never ſinned againſt Him: for, though <hi>Lot</hi> (not without guiltineſſe) did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from <hi>Abraham,</hi> chooſing <hi>Sodom</hi> to live in, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worldly accommodation, for which he met with much oppreſſion and ſoul-vexation, (both which, the word in the Original doth ſignifie) Yet the Lord did not only preſerve him from <hi>Sodom's</hi> judgment, but He doth yet preſerve his memory in eſteem by theſe manifold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of His reſpect to him, <hi>He delivered juſt Lot, that righteous man, who vexed his righteous ſoul.</hi> 6.

It is the lot of the truly godly, to be brought into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great ſtraits, not only by outward troubles, but by inward temptations; both which come ordinarily together upon the Children of the Lord, that ſo their manifold corruptions may be born down, the ſeveral graces of God's Spirit in them may be tried, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by exerciſe, and the power, faithfulneſſe, and love of Chriſt manifeſted and commended in their thorow-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and deliverance: for, they from whoſe caſe this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is drawn, were in both theſe exerciſes at once; and the word, <hi>temptation,</hi> here, doth ordinarily in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſignifie both afflictions and temptations to ſin. 3. While the Children of the Lord are exerciſed with outward afflictions and inward temptations, they are alſo oftentimes both ignorant of a way of delivery, and anxious concerning it, as if their ſtraits, and the way of their out-gate, were hid from the Lord, as it is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27. for, this conſolation, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly,</hi> is fitted for ſuch a caſe, and ſo doth ſuppoſe it to be ordinary. 4. The Lord's taking notice of the ſtraits of the Godly, and His knowledge of the way of their deliverance, ſhould be to them a ſufficient ground of comfort, both againſt their ſtraits and their ignorance of a way of out-gate, His love having engaged His power and faithfulneſſe to make forth-coming for them every thing His infinit Wiſdom ſeeth to be moſt for their good: for, for this very end, is this conſolation given to the Godly, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver them out of temptation,</hi> that they may be comforted both againſt their ſtraits, and their ignorance of a way of delivery. 5.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:105751:152"/>
threatning formerly given out againſt all the ungodly, is here particularly applied to ſome, <hi>chiefly thoſe that walk after the fleſh.</hi> 3.

Lawful Magiſtracy is a Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſo precious in God's account, that He will let out a ſpecial meaſure of His wrath upon men, for want of inward reſpect to it in their hearts; yea, for any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that may weaken the due eſteem thereof in the hearts of others, even though they were Heathens that were inveſted with that Office: for, though Magiſtrates were generally ſuch at this time, Yet there is a ſpecial degree of wrath threatned againſt them, who either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue in their hearts, or diſgrace by their expreſſions, that Ordinance, <hi>Especially thoſe who despiſe Government, and are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dignities.</hi> 5.

The more ſtout-hearted men are in their ſinful courſes, out-facing all challenges, and the more wedded to their own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not fearing to diſgrace any that have a calling to oppoſe them in their wickedneſſe, the more wrath have they to expect from God: for, thus is the ſin of theſe men aggreged, who are here threatned with a ſpecial meaſure of wrath, <hi>Preſumptuous are they, ſelf-willed.</hi> 7. Although ſedition and diſloyalty to lawful Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie be the ordinary charge which falſe teachers give in againſt he faithful Servants of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.1, 5. and

                  <p>The Apoſtle, having ſhown how unlike theſe falſe teachers who deſpiſe Magiſtracy and Government among Chriſtians, are to the moſt glorious creatures of God, the good Angels, He ſheweth here how like they are in this, and the reſt of their carriage, to the baſeſt of the creatures, the bruit beaſts: and the reſemblances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, which, the Apoſtle's words may lead us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are eſpecially three, 1. As the beaſts are void of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon; ſo are they of heavenly wiſdom. 2. As the beaſts do readily trample under foot the moſt precious things; ſo do they ſpeak evil of the things they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not: whereby is eſpecially meant their oppoſing of Magiſtracy and Government among Chriſtians, and their ſlandering of the doctrine of holineſſe, ſo much preſt by the Apoſtles, as if it had been contrary to the liberty of Chriſtians. 3. As the beaſts are framed for deſtruction; ſo are they for utter perdition: which is not to be underſtood as if they that have immortal ſouls could come to nothing as the beaſts, but that they are appointed for eternal torment, which they do procure to themſelves, as the beaſt is appointed for the ſlaughter. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. However men of erroneous opinions, and vile affections, may be in ſo high eſteem in the Church, by reaſon of their fair pretences and ſpecious titles they aſſume to themſelves, as to draw a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable faction therein after them; yet doth the Lord eſteem ſuch (and will in his own time diſcover them to be, what they are in effect) baſe and beaſtly in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and carriage: for, here theſe falſe teachers, who pretended to be the only fountains of conſolation to the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. and patrons of chriſtian liberty, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. by ſuch fair pretences, gaining to themſelves a numerous party, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. are declared by the Spirit of the Lord, to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:105751:154"/>
be <hi>as natural bruit beaſts.</hi> 2. When men are led by their ſenſual appetite, not by holy reaſon, and do become very adventrous in paſſing moſt hard ſentences againſt things they underſtand leaſt, they have then the characters of a beaſtly diſpoſition and carriage: for, both theſe are here made reſemblances betwixt the beaſts and falſe teachers, who <hi>as natural bruit beaſts ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 3. When men do thus reſemble the beaſts in their diſpoſition and carriage, it is the cleareſt evidence that can be, that they are appointed for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the beaſt is for the ſlaughter; and that however they may, as fed beaſts, proſper for a time; yet their end ſhall be much worſe than theirs: for, the Apoſtle makes the reſemblance alſo in this, that as the beaſt is <hi>to be taken and deſtroyed,</hi> ſo ſhall they <hi>utterly periſh.</hi> 4. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that abideth the wicked, doth conſiſt in a through and continual torment of ſoul and body, in the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all comfort, and that to all eternity, without any hope of recovery: which is imported in this, <hi>they ſhall utterly periſh.</hi> 5. Whatever deſtruction cometh upon wicked men, it is of their own procuring, they do in time by their ſins treaſure-up the wrath, and gather the fewel which ſhall ſeize upon them, and burn them up to all eternity: for, <hi>they ſhall utterly periſh in their own deſtruction.</hi>

                  <p>Here is a further amplification of the ſin and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe falſe teachers, whom the Apoſtle hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly deſcribed and threatned. The ſubſtance whereof, is, That they ſhall want nothing of the wrath due to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:105751:155"/>
thoſe who count it their heaven to exceed in all carnal delights, notwithſtanding of the light of the Goſpel, thereby diſgracing their holy profeſſion, and making but a ſport of deceiving their own ſouls, ſince they can in the mean time deceive others, inſinuating themſelves in the eſteem and ſociety of the Godly, whether in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious or ordinary feaſts, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. who are ſo under the power of their unclean luſts, that they cannot but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their filthy diſpoſition, being altogether impotent to reſiſt temptations themſelves, and enſnaring with their errors and vile practices ſuch others as are not well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in knowledge and grace; And who are ſo ſold to the love of their gain, that they make it their heart-exerciſe to attain thereto: for all which, he pronounceth them heirs of God's fearful curſe. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The wrath of God againſt ſin had need to be oft inculcated to the guilty, and knit unto the ſeveral branches of their ſin, that ſo they may have the more lively apprehenſions of that wrath, and may have their hearts accuſtomed to think upon it, whenſoever they think upon their ſins, that ſo they may be either ſtopped in the courſe of their ſin, and haſtened to repentance, or left the more inexcuſable: Therefore the Apoſtle, in branching out the ſin of falſe teachers and their followers, doth ſo frequently intermix threatnings, or ſome new repreſentation of that wrath they have to expect, <hi>They ſhall utterly periſh,</hi> in the former Verſe, and here, <hi>they ſhall receive the reward of unrighteouſneſs:</hi> and they are <hi>curſed children.</hi> 2. When God reckoneth with the wicked, they ſhall not want a grain weight of the wrath due to them; for, ſince they have ſlighted the uſe-making of Chriſt's righteouſneſſe, which makes ſinners righteous; and the ſtudy of holineſſe, which proveth them righteous, <hi>they ſhall receive the reward of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> which, in the Original, doth ſignifie a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of wrath to their ſin. 3. That which doth ripen wicked men for wrath, is not their ſins only, ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, but mainly the ſeveral aggravations ordinarily attending their ſins, whereof there may be ſeen here nine
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:105751:155"/>
in number, As, 1. This doth exceedingly aggrege mens ſin, when they count it their very paradiſe to ſatisfie their luſts; for, ſo the word in the Original, <hi>They count it their</hi> Eden <hi>to riot.</hi> The more Heaven men apprehend in their ſins, the more Hell they will find. 2. When men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo impudently bent upon their luſts, that neither the light of the worlds knowledge of their ſin, nor th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> light of the Word diſcovering the evil and hazard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth reſtrain them; both which may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this other aggravation of their ſin, <hi>They count it pleaſure to riot in the day time.</hi> 3. When men by their ſins, do ſtain a holy profeſſion that they have made before the world: for, if theſe men had not had a fair profeſſion and high eſteem in the Church, they could not have been <hi>ſpots and blemiſhes while they feaſted</hi> with the Lords people; which is here made another aggravation of their guilt. 4. When men do not only live in ſin, but do make a ſport of it, beguiling their own hearts with groundleſſe apprehenſions that there is neither ſuch evil nor hazard therein, as the Word holdeth forth, and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſometimes ſuggeſteth: for, this is another aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>They ſport themſelves in their own deceivings.</hi> 5. When in the mean time of their living in the ſlavery of their luſts, they are carefull to keep up their eſteem with the Godly, and attend all occaſions of converſe with them, that ſo they may cloak their ſins: for, it is here made another aggravation of their guilt, that all this wickedneſſe is committed <hi>while they feaſt with the Lord's People.</hi> 6. When mens luſts are ſo vigorous within, that they manifeſt their predominancy in their very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage: for, this is a further aggravation of their ſin, <hi>They have eyes full of adultery,</hi> 7. When men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo impotent to reſiſt their luſts, that the ſatisfying thereof becometh their very element, out of which they cannot reſt, as the word here ſignifieth, <hi>They cannot ceaſe from ſin:</hi> which is alſo another aggravation of their guilt. 8. When ſinners become infectious, and inſnaring, with the bait (as the word, <hi>beguiling,</hi> in the Original ſignifies)
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:105751:156"/>
of fair pretences, many others, to ſwallow down their foul errors and profane practices: this alſo is a high ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their guilt. 9. When men make it their heart-exerciſe, whereabout they ſpend their wit and affections to fulfill their fleſhly deſires: for, this is here the laſt aggravation of their ſin. <hi>An heart they have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with covetous practices. Doct.</hi> 4. Although it be poſſible that the Lord's People may without guiltineſſe admit into their ordinary and intimate ſociety, the worſt of men, while they do not diſcover themſelves, as is clear concerning <hi>Ahithophel</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> Yet doth the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch into their ſociety oftentimes prove a great ſnare, eſpecially to thoſe that are admitted, while they take occaſion there-from to harden themſelves in thoſe ſins, and to count the leſſe of that vileneſſe, the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whereof doth not mar their eſteem and ſociety with the Godly: for, this is one thing that helped theſe ſoul-deceivers to deceive themſelves and willingly to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the evil of their own condition, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all their wickedneſſe, they were admitted to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Godly, and did paſſe among them for ſuch; <hi>While they feaſt with you.</hi> 5. When men labour not to mortifie their inward luſts, the Lord oftentimes doth juſtly ſuffer them to manifeſt the predominancy of theſe luſts over them in their outward carriage; As grace which is lively within, will put ſome beauty upon the outward man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.1. So corruptions vigorous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in will readily bewray the perſon to be its ſlave, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Having eyes full of adultery,</hi> or (as it is in the Original) <hi>of the adultreſs.</hi> 6. So bewitching is the ſpirit of error where it entereth, and ſo devoted are deluded ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſeducing teachers, That though theſe teachers be judicially plagued of God (as ordinarily ſuch are) with profanity of life; Yet this doth not make their followers loath at them, or abhor their errors: for, though <hi>they did riot in the day time,</hi> and <hi>had eyes full of adultery,</hi> Yet were they ſtill <hi>beguiling unſtable ſouls.</hi> 7. Thoſe who are not rooted in knowledge by clear information and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:105751:156"/>
meditation of the Truth, and have not their hearts eſtabliſhed with Grace by the frequent exerciſe thereof, will readily be a prey to ſoul-deceivers: for, theſe whom they beguile are here called <hi>Unſtable ſouls.</hi> 8. No man doth ſerve one idol alone, but many at once: he that is wedded to worldly pleaſures, will be alſo to his credit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Therefore doth the Apoſtle deſcribe theſe men here as ſlaves to all theſe three idols at once, to their <hi>pleaſures,</hi> which were their Eden; to their <hi>credit,</hi> which made them hold forth baits to take many followers; and to their <hi>gain,</hi> wherewith their heart was exerciſed, that ſo their pleaſures and credit might be attained and upheld. Laſtly, They who, profeſſing themſelves to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord, do ſpend their immortal ſpirits upon the unworthy things of this preſent life, not truſting to his care and providence in the moderate uſe of lawfull means whereunto their profeſſion doth oblige them, They do forfeit their right they pretend to have to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of His Children, and ſerve themſelves heirs to His curſe: for, becauſe their heart is exerciſed with <hi>covetous practices,</hi> they are <hi>curſed children.</hi>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:105751:157"/>
of theſe ſame idols, that even extraordinary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition could not reſtrain him. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men that really enter the way of Chriſt can never totally or finally fall from it, by reaſon of the Lord's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. and unchangeableneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. Yet they who have been once in opinion ſound, and in external practice blameleſſe, remaining in the mean time without any inward ſaving change, may make apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie from both: for, ſuch had theſe men been, of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They have forſaken the right way.</hi> 2. Love to ſome unmortified luſt, eſpecially covetouſneſſe, is the prime cauſe both of much apoſtaſie, and of extream vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in ſinful courſes: for, ſo was it with theſe falſe teachers and their followers, their heart was exerciſed with covetous practices in the former Verſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they forſook the right way,</hi> imitating <hi>Balaam</hi> in the violent proſecution of that idol. 3. When the right way, which is the way of truth and holineſſe, is forſaken, men can keep no certain courſe, but muſt needs be like wandring ſtars or planets (as the word here ſignifieth) ever ſeeking, and never finding, that true ſatisfaction they might have had, and have forſaken, by forſaking the right way; <hi>And are gone aſtray.</hi> 4. When the Lord's ordinary means, to reclaim ſinners from their luſts, doth not prevail with them, the Lord is juſtly provoked to give them up to go on in their own way, over the belly of more than ordinary oppoſition, if they have it, till they periſh: for, <hi>Balaam</hi> was not reſtrained by means more ordinary in his time, and therefore he is not reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by means more extraordinary; <hi>He loved the wages of unrighteouſneſſe, though he was rebuked for his iniquity by the dumb aſſe.</hi> 5. Covetouſneſſe being once rooted in the heart, and propoſed as a man's main end, it is ſo powerful and imperious an idol, that it will make the covetous man adventure upon any courſe, though never ſo unrighteous, and go over never ſo much oppoſition in the way of his gain: for, though the wages that <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired, were wages of unrighteouſneſſe, becauſe they
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:105751:157"/>
could not be had but by curſing the People, whom God had bleſt; Yet <hi>he loved</hi> them, and purſued them, <hi>though the dumb aſſe forbad his madneſſe</hi> in ſo doing. 6. The more oppoſition from the word, or diſpenſations of God, men do go over in the proſecution of their luſts, the greater is their guilt, and the more wrath have they to expect from God, eſpecially when they trace the ſteps of ſinners, whom God hath by His Word and Providence oppoſed before them: for, it is here made an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, and cauſe of a ſpecial meaſure of wrath, that theſe men followed the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who would go on after his luſts, <hi>though the dumb aſſe, ſpeaking with mans voice, forbad his madneſſe.</hi> 7. It is in ſome reſpect more eaſie to work the greateſt miracle in nature, than to ſtop the courſe of a ſinner, violently purſuing his luſts; the reaſonleſſe creatures, who have no active oppoſition in them to their Maker's will, being more prone to obey Him, contrary to their ordinary courſe, than reaſonable creatures, without ſpecial grace and aſſiſtance, can be, either to follow the direction of His Word, or their own reaſon contrary to their corrupt and vile affections: for, while <hi>Balaam</hi> goeth on in his ſinful courſe, <hi>The dumb aſſe, ſpeaking as if it had a mans voice, forbad his madneſſe.</hi> 8. A croſſe providence meeting ſinners in a courſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the revealed Will of the Lord, hath a language to them, proclaiming their madneſſe, and prohibiting them to go on in their ſins, which they ought to hear and obey, although it be not ſo expreſſe, as when one man reproves another; See <hi>Mica.</hi> 6.9. for, though we read not, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 22.) that <hi>Balaam's</hi> aſſe did either expreſly call him mad, or prohibit his courſe; Yet here the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God putteth that commentary upon what it ſpake, which alſo <hi>Balaam</hi> ſhould have done, <hi>That the dumb aſſe ſpeaking with mans voice, forbad the madneſſe of the prophet.</hi> 9. It is the height of madneſſe to walk contrary to the revealed Will of God, how much uſe of reaſon ſoever men may have to cover their wickedneſſe, and attain to their idols: for, though much carnal reaſon and policy
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:105751:158"/>
did appear in <hi>Balaam's</hi> way, Yet <hi>the dumb aſſe forbad the madneſſe of the prophet.</hi> 10. A man who is mad in the purſuit of his luſts, and ſo incorrigible, that even extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary means do not reclaim him, may, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, be imployed by the Lord for revealing of His Will to His People, and for the edifying of His Church; and in the diſcharge of that imployment may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with much heavenly matter, and ſuitable expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ought to be heard and obeyed by the Church in the diſcharge of his imployment, while he is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be what he is, and is not according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eſtabliſhed in the Houſe of God put from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: for, ſuch a man was <hi>Balaam,</hi> whom the Lord did imploy, and by whom He did deliver moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and edifying Truths to His Church: all which is clear by comparing this place of Scripture, with <hi>Numb.</hi> 21,22. chapters.</p>

They that do moſt hurt to the ſouls of the Lord's People, by venting moſt dangerous errors among them, make oftentimes the faireſt promiſes of doing moſt good to them, that ſo they may feed People with vain expectations of more than ever they can find from them; faithful Miniſters, being

                  <p>Here is the next courſe which ſoul-deceivers take to enſnare poor ſouls by their errors, to wit, a high and lofty ſtile of language, which their love to their luſts made them to affect, and whereby they were very taking with unmortified wanton profeſſors, eſpecially ſuch as have been turned from Paganiſm, to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity.

When the vail of odd and ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring expreſſions, wherein falſe teachers delight, is laid aſide, and the naked purpoſe, held forth under them, is conſidered, it will be found of no worth, but either ſome untruth, or that which maketh nothing to the true ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſouls; both which are vanity: for here their <hi>great ſwelling words,</hi> are <hi>words of vanity.</hi> 3. An affected lofty ſtile of language in uttering things divine, doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily flow from ſome unmortified luſt in the ſpeaker, eſpecially the love of applauſe; and is alſo mainly taking with wanton unhumbled ſouls, when it doth provoke to more vanity and lightneſſe, by diverting them from the ſtudy of their natural vileneſſe, their need of Jeſus, and the neceſſity of the mortification of their heart-evils: for, they who ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity, <hi>they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure through the luſts of the fleſh, through much wantonneſſe:</hi> both which laſt clauſes may be underſtood, as well of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:105751:159"/>
principle which doth bend the preacher to that ſtrain, as of the qualification of theſe hearers with whom it is moſt taking. 4. There may be a very remarkable external change from vile and blaſphemous opinions, idolatrous and profane practices, to a profeſſion of Truth and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe of the outward converſation to it, where there is no ſaving or inward change made of the heart, from the love of ſecret luſts to the love of Chriſt and His grace; the one without the other may be occaſioned by the power of example, the majeſty and clearneſſe of Truth, which is in nothing contrary to natures light, the beauty of holineſſe ſhining in the converſation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and outward advantages which ſometimes may attend the profeſſion of Truth and Holineſſe: for, theſe here who were yet given to <hi>the luſts of their fleſh,</hi> and <hi>much wantonneſſe</hi> had once <hi>clean eſcaped from</hi> the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous opinions, profane and idolatrous practices of thoſe without the Church, who are here called <hi>them that live in error.</hi> 5. Whatever change of this ſort be wrought upon men, unleſs they labour to find the power of Chriſts Spirit changing, their nature, and mortifying their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward luſts, they will eaſily be a prey to ſeducing ſpirits, and carried to thoſe ſins which are no leſſe diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, and deſtructive to their own ſouls, than thoſe wherein they lived before: for here, thoſe who had once clean eſcaped from the vile opinions, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked practices wherein Pagans live, are now by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of falſe teachers, turned profane and licentious Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>The Apoſtle proveth the condition of theſe Apoſtates, whom he ſuppoſeth to have attained ſo much of the knowledge of Chriſt, as had power upon them to clenſe their outſide, to be much worſe than it was before that change, becauſe their ſin and judgment had been leſſe if they had never known any thing of the way of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion revealed in the Goſpel, than it will be now, after that hath been cleared to their underſtanding; and yet in doctrine and practice they do caſt off another part of the Goſpel, to wit, that which preſſeth the duties of holineſſe upon juſtified perſons. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Even thoſe who are deſtitute of the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, and ſtrangers to the mortification of heart-pollutions, may find ſo much power of the knowledge of Him, as to make them clenſe their external converſation; the knowledge of Chriſt is ſo raviſhing a ſubject, able to divert even an unrenewed mind from many ſinful ſpeculations, that even a hypocrite, living in love with his ſecret luſts, may <hi>eſcape the pollutions</hi> that are breaking forth in <hi>the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Christ.</hi> 2. They who have not attained to a heart-outcaſt with ſin, and ſome inward mortification thereof, will, upon fit occaſions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, be readily enſnared again, and made ſlaves to theſe ſame ſins which were externally reformed, and from the outward acts whereof only, they had made an eſcape: for, theſe here ſpoken of, having only eſcaped the pollutions that are in the world through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, <hi>they are again intangled and overcome.</hi>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:105751:161"/>
3. Before men be overcome by temptation, they are firſt entiſed with the apprehenſion of ſome pleaſure, profit, or the like, to be had by their ſins; with which apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the hazard and danger of committing the ſin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and hid, as the fiſher's hook is by the bait, which is the metaphor in the Apoſtle's expreſſion, <hi>They are again intangled and overcome.</hi> 4. The guilt and deſerved wrath againſt thoſe who after illumination by the truth, and external renunciation of their ſins, do return back again to them, is much greater, than if they had never been ſo far enlightened and reformed, their ſins being now againſt light, and ſome taſts of ſweetneſſe, which is ſometimes letten out even to thoſe who do but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally renounce their ſins, and betake themſelves to the way of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, &amp;c. for, of ſuch the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſaith here, <hi>The latter end is worſe with them than the beginning.</hi> 5. Thoſe to whom the Lord doth make known the way of free juſtification by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, to them alſo He doth deliver His holy Commandments, the obedience whereof they ought to ſet about in His ſtrength: for, ſo much is imported in the Apoſtle's words, that having <hi>known the way of righteouſneſſe,</hi> there was <hi>a holy Commandment delivered to them.</hi> 6. It is leſſe difficult, and more ordinary for men, to adhere in their opinion and profeſſion, to the way of free juſtification by Chriſt's imputed righteouſneſſe, when that way is once cleared to their minds, than it is for them to inſiſt in the conſtant practice of holy duties, which Chriſt preſſeth upon them, and offereth them ſtrength for, there being even in corrupt nature, which is moſt averſe from holy duties, ſome inclination to be made bleſſed, and that freely; which is imported in the Apoſtle's changing of the expreſſion: for, he doth not ſay, that after they had known the way of righteouſneſſe, they, had turned from it; importing, that theſe falſe teachers did ſtill profeſſe and preach juſtification by His righteouſneſſe; but, <hi>after they had known that way, they turned from the holy Commandment delivered to them;</hi> their

Sin ought to be repreſented by the Lord's Miniſters in its abominable vileneſſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when men labour to palliate their filthy practices with fair pretences.

They who after external refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and great profeſſion of holineſſe, do return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and continue in, their renounced ſins, do thereby give evidence that they were never inwardly or really changed in their nature: for theſe, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here, being ſtill dogs and ſwine, were only waſhen externally, and did vomit up by confeſſion and ſeeming renunciation, their filthy practices, to which they did return again, <hi>as the dog returneth to his vomit, and the ſow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire;</hi> and ſo this place can make nothing for the apoſtaſie of the Saints. Laſtly, It is lawfull for the Miniſters of Chriſt to make uſe of common ſimilitudes, or proverbs, to clear the Truth, and fix it in the minds of thoſe that are led by ſenſe, (providing they do make uſe, eſpecially of ſuch

               <p>In the ſecond part of the Chapter, the Apoſtle maketh uſe of his former Doctrine concerning Chriſt's ſecond coming, for the up-ſtirring of the Lord's People to the ſtudy of holineſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to wait and pray for that day, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. when they had ground to look for ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent an eſtate, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. as might provoke them to much diligence in making ready for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to eſteem the delay thereof to be granted for the furtherance of their ſalvation, in which ſtrain <hi>Paul</hi> had inſiſted much in his Epiſtles, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16.

                  <p>THe Apoſtle doth here preſent to them his chief ſcope intended by him in both the Epiſtles, which was the wakening and rouſing of theſe ſincere-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to whom he writeth, to an actual conſideration, and conſtant practice of known Truths, that had been delivered to them by the Prophets, himſelf, and other Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Miniſters of Chriſt ought not only to intend, as their ſcope, ſome particular advantage to the ſouls of the Lord's People by all the Meſſages they carry to them; But alſo in their
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:105751:163"/>
delivery of them, frequently to make clear to the People what their main intent is, that ſo themſelves may be engaged to direct all they deliver toward that ſcope, the People may have it the better fixed in their minds, and all that they hear, relating to that ſcope, may be the better underſtood, and have the greater weight; otherwiſe, the greateſt variety of Truth, and moſt taking expreſſions, can have but a ſlender and ſoon evaniſhing impreſſion upon that hearer, who cannot be able to condeſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the principal ſcope of the ſpeaker: for, here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath propoſed their up-ſtirring as his ſcope, and by his frequent mentioning of it in the firſt Chapter, and this alſo, did ty himſelf to ſpeak to it, and made his hearers able to judge how all he delivered did make for it; <hi>This ſecond Epiſtle (Beloved) I now write unto you, in both which I ſtir up your pure minds.</hi> 2. A Miniſter's main ſcope, ought not to be the acquiting of himſelf before men in his duty, ſo as he may be free of cenſure, neither only the clear information of the minds of the Lord's People in the Truth, neither yet the bringing forth of ſome new things which they that live under the Goſpel have not formerly heard, But more principally he muſt ſtudy the quickning and wakening of the affections of the Lord's People to a delight in, and reſolution to walk in the practice of Truths they have formerly known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: for, it is here the Apoſtle's ſcope, <hi>to ſtir them up,</hi> a word frequently uſed in the New Teſtament of raiſing the dead, and wakening thoſe that are aſleep, <hi>by putting them in remembrance,</hi> which ſignifieth to repreſent of new to the mind and memory truths formerly known and remembred. 3. A Miniſter that would prevail with the Lord's People, ought both to keep love to them, that his pains may flow therefrom, and in his dealing with them to expreſſe his love and high eſteem of any meaſure of ſincerity he hath diſcerned in them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Apoſtle ſtile theſe whom he intends to ſtir up, <hi>Beloved,</hi> and doth acknowledge that they had <hi>ſincere and pure minds.</hi> 4. Even thoſe who for ſincerity of heart,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:105751:163"/>
and honeſty of their aims and intentions, may a bide the trial of Goſpel-light, have great need of many meſſages to the ſame purpoſe, and of much up-ſtirring to the right uſe-making of them, there being in them that have the cleareſt underſtanding, much darkneſſe, and many miſtakes concerning the Truths of God; and in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt Believer, whoſe heart is moſt lively and forward in duties, a great remnant of hypocriſie, deadneſſe and unwillingneſſe to the practice of many known duties: for, the Apoſtle findeth it neceſſary to write two Epiſtles <hi>for the up-ſtirring of pure minds,</hi> or, as the word in the Original ſignifieth, minds ſo ſincere that they may be judged by the Sun. 5. The Word of the Lord hath moſt weight with People, when not only they that carry it to them, are holy, and ſo eſteemed by the People, but the minds of the hearers are carried above the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Jeſus Chriſt, and their hearts in hearing or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, are filled with ſome ſenſe of His Soveraignity who doth imploy thoſe Meſſengers, and of His uſefulneſſe for them in all His Offices: Therefore, that the Word which the Apoſtle here exhorteth them to ſtudy, may have the more weight, he leadeth them not only to look upon the Meſſengers that carried it, as holy men; but to conſider the ſoveraignity, excellency, and uſefulneſſe of Chriſt in His Offices to which He is anointed; <hi>Be mindfull of the Words which were ſpoken by the holy Prophets, and of the Commandments of us the Apoſtles of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 6. The way to keep life in the affections of the Lord's People, is to have their wit and memory actually exerciſed about the Truths of God, both the Propheſies and Promiſes of good to the Church and People of God, and to preſſe the Precepts enjoyning their duty: for, that the Apoſtle may gain his principal ſcope, to wit, the rouſing up of their affections, he maketh this his ſpeech ſubordinate thereto, <hi>That they might be mindful of the Words that were ſpoken before by the holy Prophets, and of the Commandments of the Apostles of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 7. Although the Lord
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:105751:164"/>
hath letten forth His mind to His Church by little and little, in ſeveral Ages of the World, and by ſeveral Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. Yet is there ſuch a compleat har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony among all the parts of His Mind, that all ſerve for one and the ſame principal ſcope, the up-ſtirring of the Lord's People to a hearty receiving and uſe-making of Chriſt and His Truth; for, unto this ſcope the Apoſtle here affirmeth, that the whole Doctrine both of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles did harmoniouſly tend.</p>

Variety of very fierce and diſcouraging oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the way of Chriſt, and that from ſeveral ſorts of enemies, is the lot wherewith the Church and People of Chriſt may reſolve to be exerciſed: for, the Apoſtle, having forewarned of, and guarded againſt, open perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors in the former Epiſtle, ſubtil and fair pretending. Hereticks in the former Chapter, he doth here forewarn of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and guard againſt, a third ſort, to wit, profane <hi>ſcoffers</hi> of Chriſt's ſecond coming. 2. The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hazard that the beſt are in of being drawn aſide, ſome one way or other, from the Truth and Way of Chriſt, by ſuch variety of oppoſition as they ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:105751:164"/>
meet with, ought both to ſtir up Miniſters care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to warn and guard People againſt the ſame; and People to the uſe-making of their pains: for, after the Apoſtle had guarded againſt open perſecutors and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deceivers, he doth here bring in the forewarning of the third ſort of enemies, <hi>ſcoffers:</hi> which may be taken both for a reaſon of his pains in writing two Epiſtles, as alſo for a reaſon why they ſhould be ſtirred up by what he had written, <hi>Knowing this,</hi> that beſides furious perſecutors, and ſubtil deceivers, they ſhould alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with profane <hi>ſcoffers.</hi> They who have not been terrified by the firſt ſort, nor deceived by the ſecond, are in hazard to be diſcouraged by the third. 3. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and neceſſity of being exerciſed with variety of oppoſition in the Way of Chriſt, is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſtianity which ought to be held in the firſt place by all that reſolve to adhere to any other ſaving Truth; they who do not firſt know this, and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, reſolve upon adherance to the Truth in Chriſt's ſtrength, will readily, when they meet with ſuch a lot, be ſurpriſed therewith, and either forſake the Truth, or faint in their adherance to it: Therefore the Apoſtle would have them <hi>knowing this firſt,</hi> that after ſeveral other ſorts of enemies, there were alſo <hi>to come in the laſt dayes, ſcoffers.</hi> 4. There are no ſuch pure or peaceable times to be expected by the Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God within time, wherein the fore-mentioned lot is not to be expected; they who dream of the beſt times to the Church on Earth, look for them toward the end of time: and yet the Spirit of God here forwarneth, that beſide the rage of perſecutors, and prevailing of hereticks, <hi>there ſhall come in the laſt dayes ſcoffers.</hi> 5. It is a clear evidence that men are ſlaves to their luſts, when they do ſtrongly deſire an eternall enjoyment, of this preſent world, and labour to baniſh out of their own hearts the thoughts of a day of judgment; Yea, their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is alſo the cauſe why they give up themſelves to the ſervice of their luſts, the believing conſideration of the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:105751:165"/>
terror of that day to the wicked, being a ſpecial help to mortification and of the ſweetneſſe thereof to the Godly, a ſpecial encouragement in the battel againſt corruption: for, their <hi>ſcoffing at the promiſe of Chriſt's ſecond coming,</hi> may be looked upon here both as the evidence and cauſe of their <hi>walking after their ungodly luſts.</hi> 6. When men are left of God to vile opinions for not receiving the Truth in love, they are then oftentimes plagued further, not only with deviliſh wit, to find out ſeeming reaſons for the defence of them, very plauſible to themſelves, and others like themſelves; but alſo to take manifeſt falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods for undeniable grounds of their errors: for, theſe mockers here lay all the weight of their blaſphemous opinion upon this ſeeming reaſon, That <hi>ſince the fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were, &amp;c.</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from the Apoſtle's contrary inſtance, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. to be a manifeſt falſhood. 7. Although it be a ſweet mercy, much to be acknowledged by the Lord's People, that things in nature do ordinarily keep one conſtant courſe, and that they are not terrified with the frequent change thereof, but may be thereby confirmed in the faith of the Lords conſtancy and faithfulneſſe, as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.90, 91. Yet men that are in love with their luſts, do make a wofull uſe of the conſideration thereof, hardening themſelves in their conceit that there ſhall never be a change, that ſo they may ſin the more ſecurely: for, thus did theſe ſcoffers abuſe this mercy, taking occaſion there-from to queſtion the promiſe of Chriſt's ſecond coming, and to walk the more boldly after their ungodly luſts; <hi>ſince all things continue as they were from the beginning of the Creation.</hi>

                  <p>Becauſe theſe mockers did pretend reaſon for their blaſphemous opinion, the Apoſtle taketh pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it by ſeveral reaſons, ſuch as they did not love to underſtand. The firſt, taken from the work of Creation, is, That the whole fabrick of the Heavens was ſet up by a Word of God's. The ſecond, taken from an ordinary and daily work of Providence, is, That the Earth, being the loweſt and heavieſt of the Elements, is by His Word kept from being overflowed by the Waters that go about it, and cover it in many places, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. The third, taken from an extraordinary work of Providence, is, That by a Word of His, letting out the Waters to their natural courſe, the whole Earth was once overflowed in the time of the floud, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. The concluſion drawn from theſe three, is, That His Word is a ſufficient ground for us to believe that He ſhall come again to judgment, and that this whole frame of Nature is keeping to the fore, as fewel to burn up all the ungodly, eſpecially profane mockers of that day, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. When vile blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies are not only boldly vented but maintained with ſome ſhew of reaſon, to make them taking with people, they ought then to be ſolidly confuted, and born down with ſtrength of reaſon, grounded upon the Scripture. Though otherwiſe, when they are only ſimply or raſhly aſſerted, and are not taking with hearers, it is ſufficient to reject them with deteſtation, and expreſſions of our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency of them: for, becauſe this blaſphemy had a ſeeming reaſon to back it with, the Apoſtle taketh pains to confute it by many ſolid reaſons, drawn from the Scriptures. 2. They that are in love with their luſts and errors, they love alſo to be ignorant of theſe Truths, the knowledge whereof might diſquiet them in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their luſts, and maintaining their errors; Yea, they would willingly be ignorant of what they do know, that ſo they might ſin the more ſecurely: for, theſe men
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:105751:166"/>
here, whom the faith of a day of judgment could not but terrifie, are diſcovered to be <hi>willingly ignorant</hi> of theſe things that might have helped them to believe it. 3. As the whole frame of Nature had its being, and hath its ſubſiſtance by the Word of God; So the believing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this, is ſufficient to make the moſt unlikely thing that God hath promiſed, to be credible to us. They who look right upon what God hath already done by a Word, will never think any thing He hath promiſed or foretold, impoſſible: for, the Apoſtle giveth this as a ſufficient confutation of their blaſphemous mockery at the promiſed appearance of Chriſt; That ſince <hi>by the Word of the Lord the Heavens were of old, and the Earth ſtanding out of the Water, and in the Water,</hi> it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible that all ſhall be taken down with as little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty as it was at firſt ſet up, and hath hitherto been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: which is the force of the Apoſtle's reaſoning here. 4. It is a ſtanding miracle of Nature that the Earth is not overflowed by the Water, while one part of it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered therewith, and another not, whereof, though ſome probable natural reaſons may be given, Yet all will not ſatisfie, till we look to God's Decree of Providence, and His executing thereof by His Word, by which <hi>the Earth is ſtanding out of the Water, and in the Water.</hi> 5. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever error, when it is looked upon alone, as the cunning craftineſſe of men uſually repreſenteth it, may ſeem to have a kind of likelihood and probability, Yet when it is compared with the clear light of the Truth ſhining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, it doth manifeſtly appear to be a lying deceit: for, that plauſible aſſertion, <hi>All things continue as they were from the beginning,</hi> ver. 4. wherewith theſe ſcoffers la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to weaken the faith of a day of judgment, is clearly diſcovered to be a manifeſt lie, by this contrary inſtance, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>The World that then</hi> (to wit, before the floud) <hi>was, being overflowed with Water, periſhed.</hi> 6. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular judgments upon ſome wicked men, while others are ſpared, do prove that there ſhall be a general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for, ſeing ſome are juſtly puniſhed here, and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:105751:166"/>
others, deſerving, no leſſe, are ſpared, He who is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and impartially juſt, muſt have a day for judging theſe afterward, who are ſpared in time: Therefore doth the Apoſtle bring in the inſtance of the floud upon the ungodly World, not only as a contradiction to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. but as a proof againſt them of a day of judgment; <hi>The World being overflowed with Water, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</hi> 7. The day of Chriſt's ſecond coming will be a moſt dreadfull and terrible day to all ungodly men, who baniſh the thoughts of it, and deſire eternally to poſſeſſe this preſent World, and the pleaſures thereof; when they ſhall ſee all thoſe creatures, which they have abuſed to ſerve them in their ſerving of their luſts, burning fewel, to kindle (as it were) that flame, which ſhall burn them up for ever and ever, and ſhall not be ſo happy as to be deſtroyed with the reſt of the creatures, but ſhall then enter into their never-ending torment: for, <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth which are now, are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto Fire againſt the day of judgment and perdition of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle having, by ſtrength of reaſon drawn from Scripture, overthrown the opinion of theſe mockers of Chriſt's ſecond coming, He doth in this and the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſes, hold forth three reaſons which may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Godly, concerning the delay thereof: The firſt, which is in this Verſe, is, That the delay ought not to be judged of according to our ſenſe or apprehenſion, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the duration of God, with whom that ſpace of time which ſeemeth very long to us, is but as one day, and to whom all thoſe differences of duration, which to the creatures are longer or ſhorter, are all alike, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſtantly preſent. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is ſo great affinity betwixt the hearts of the Godly, who are but in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:105751:167"/>
part renewed, and the vileſt temptations to the greateſt blaſphemies or errors, eſpecially ſuch as patronize the luſts of corrupt Nature; that when they are boldly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with pretence of reaſon, there is great hazard that there be ſome impreſſion left upon their hearts, inclining them to the ſame: Therefore, for the preventing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of this, the Apoſtle taketh pains to ſatisfie the Godly, concerning the cauſes of the delay of Chriſt's coming, which had not been needfull except they had either received, or had been in hazard to receive ſome bad impreſſion from the bold aſſertion and ſeeming rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe mockers. 2. Although it hath pleaſed the Lord to condeſcend ſo far to our ſhallow capacity, as to ſet forth to us in Scripture, and to give us leave to take up, His duration in our own tearms, while He calleth Himſelf, <hi>Yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. <hi>Which was, and is, and is to come,</hi> Rev. 1.4. <hi>The Ancient of dayes,</hi> Dan. 7.9. <hi>Whoſe years have no end,</hi> Pſal. 102.27. Yet all theſe differences of time, which to us are longer or ſhorter, are all alike to Him, whoſe duration admits of no beginning, ſucceſſion or ending, but conſiſteth in a conſtant preſentneſs of all that which ſeemeth to us paſt, or to come: for, <hi>one day is with the Lord as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day.</hi> 3.

                  <p>The ſecond ground, for ſatisfaction of the Godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the delay of Chriſt's ſecond coming, is, That that delay doth not proceed from any ſuch thing in God, (whatever men may judge) as uſually maketh men ſlow in performing their promiſes, but only from His patience toward His Elect, whoſe temper requireth time and pains for working grace in them, that they may be fitted for glory. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. We ought not to frame our thoughts of God as one man uſeth to do of another, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we think of the delay of performance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as if that delay did ſlow from want of foreſight of poſſible difficulties, weakneſſe, forgetfulneſſe, or fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whence delay among men doth ordinarily flow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in performing of them, that He will not ſtay a moment after He hath wrought what is neceſſary before the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. for, ſuch negatives as this here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, do in Scripture both import an aptneſſe in us to imagine the contrary affirmative of Him, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the contrary of what is denied, is, in a ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive degree, His property; <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning His Promiſe, as ſome men count ſlackneſs.</hi> 2. The true and ſatisfying reaſon of the delay of the ſecond coming of Chriſt, is the Lord's long-ſuffering toward His own Elect, who muſt be dealt with in order to their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in a way ſuitable to their temper, which requireth time and pains to work upon each elect ſoul come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and to the years of diſcretion, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, threatnings, promiſes and alluring motives, every one of theſe being multiplied after another, and by theſe ſame means every elect brought to that meaſure of grace, which God hath determined to work in the converted, that they may be fitted for glory: for, this is here given as the ſatisfying reaſon of the delay of Chriſt's ſecond coming, that the Lord is <hi>long-ſuffering to us-ward.</hi> 3. The Lord doth not ſoon nor eaſily gain His point even with His own Elect, but after many refuſals of His renewed offers, and ſlighting of His pains, His patient and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull love doth at laſt overcome all oppoſition in them, and ſo bringeth them to repentance: for, before they are brought to it, He <hi>is long-ſuffering to us-ward.</hi> 4. The Lord cannot fall ſhort of His intention toward any upon whom He doth take pains, nor doth His good-will to ſave, reach to any ſinners, but thoſe whom He doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make partakers of Salvation: for, the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>He is long-ſuffering to us-ward,</hi> that is, to us Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and others, elected as we are, not as yet born, or not as yet converted, not willing that any ſuch ſhould periſh, but that all of that kind ſhould come to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; So that the Scripture <hi>All,</hi> is not alwayes to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all and every individual perſon in the world, but oftentimes it is put (here comprehended in <hi>Us</hi>) for all
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:105751:168"/>
the Elect only, as is clear by comparing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. and this preſent Scripture. 5. Although the Lord do only intend the ſalvation of His Elect by His long-ſuffering and pains, Yet He is pleaſed to expreſſe His deſire of their ſalvation, in the largeſt tearms that can be, that ſo He may the more effectually prevail with His own, and render the reſt the more inexcuſable, who, except they will exclude themſelves, are not excluded by ſuch large expreſſions of the grace of God as are here, <hi>He is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> 6. All thoſe whom the Lord mindeth to ſave in an ordinary way, are firſt brought by Him to a ſenſible ſight of ſin and deſerved wrath, and to ſuch apprehenſions of mercy in God for them through Jeſus Chriſt, as maketh them turn in to Him, grieving for, and forſaking their ſins, and giving up themſelves to His ſervice: for, <hi>thoſe whom He willeth not to periſh, He willeth and maketh to come to repentance.</hi>

                  <p>The third thing whereby the Apoſtle laboureth to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Godly anent the delay of the day of judgment, is, That that day will be very unexpected and terrible to ſecure ſinners, as the coming of a thief in the night uſeth to be to a ſleeping family; and that there will be then a great change and diſſolution of the whole frame of Nature, and of all things wherein moſt men place their happineſſe; the inference from which, not being expreſt, but to be collected from the Apoſtle's ſcope, is, That it is the wiſdom of the Lord's People rather to prepare for that day, than to complain of the delay, or to be anxious concerning it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

are taken, only they do much commend to us the Lord's condeſcendency, and deſire, to have us taking up His mind, while He dimitteth Himſelf for our capacity to compare His moſt juſt and holy actions, to theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among men which are moſt abominable and hatefull to Him; Therefore is the ſuddenty and terror of Chriſt's ſecond coming, ſet forth here by the coming of a thief in the night; which practice, though it be in it ſelf ſinfull and condemned by the Lord, Yet it is made uſe of by Him, becauſe the terror and ſuddenneſſe of it is ſo well known to men, that they may by it the better conceive the manner of Chriſt's ſecond coming; <hi>But the day of the Lord will come as a chief in the night.</hi> 2. Chriſt's coming at the laſt day will be a great ſurpriſal to the moſt part of the children of men, who will not be wakened out of their ſecurity by the Word, to make preparation for it. As for theſe fore-going ſigns of that day, which the Scripture ſpeaketh of, ſuch as the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the converſion of the Jews, and that great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole courſe of Nature; ſome of them may be done in ſo little time, and ſo immediatly before that day, and others of them ſo little taken notice of, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as ſigns of that day, that, notwithſtanding of them all, the moſt part ſhall be ſurprized with it, as with the coming of <hi>a thief in the night.</hi> 3. That day of judgment will be a moſt terrible day to all who do not expect and prepare for it: There will be a ſtrange ſight, and a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full noiſe, when this great Workmanſhip, being on fire, ſhall all ruſh down, and all the delights of wicked men ſhall be burnt up before their eyes, The Lord thereby teſtifying His diſpleaſure againſt mens placing their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in theſe things, and their defiling of them, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſubſervient to their luſts, mean time ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His purpoſe to give a more cleanly and glorious Manſion to His own to dwell in; <hi>In that day the Heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo and the works that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall be burnt up.</hi> As for queſtions which may be ſtated

here, it is much more ſafe for us to give time and pains, that we may be found of Him in peace at that day, than to be taken up in enquiring and determining whether the viſible Heavens, and the Earth, and the reſt of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that kind, ſhall then be totally and for ever anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated; or, whether there ſhall be a new edition of them all, or of ſome of them only, to be laſting monuments of the power and glory of the Maker, and ſo raviſhing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Saints delight, who may through that new world follow the Lamb where-ever He goeth.</p>

                  <p>In this ſecond part of the Chapter, are contained the ſeveral uſes, which the Apoſtle draweth from his former Doctrine concerning the laſt judgment, and they are eſpecially ſix: The firſt, which is in this Verſe, is, That the conſideration of that day ſhould make all the Lord's People very inquiſitive how they may be more and more forth-coming for His honour, in the diſcharge of all the duties of holineſſe, eſpecially thoſe whereby He may be glorified in their converſation. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Miniſters of Chriſt ought not to ſatisfie themſelves to draw the Lord's People to a naked contemplation of the Truth, which Hypocrites, yea Devils, may attain unto, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. But they ought to draw every Truth they propound to them, to ſome practical uſe for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of holineſſe in the hearts and lives of their hearers, without which, peoples condemnation will be greater, than if they had not heard or known theſe Truths, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Therefore the Apoſtle doth not think it enough to have defended by reaſon the ſecond coming of Chriſt, and to tell them of ſtrange events to fall forth at that day, But doth here, and to the end of the Chapter, apply all to them for their uſe; <hi>Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought ye to be, &amp;c?</hi>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:105751:170"/>
2. The whole creation is now in a manner impriſoned, and in bondage, while they are abuſed contrary to their inclination, to the ſervice of mens luſts, and diſhonour of their Maker; from which ſlavery they ſhall be looſed at Chriſts coming, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. for, the word in the original here is uſed to ſignify the looſing of a captive, or priſoner, out of his bonds, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.30. <hi>Theſe things ſhall be diſſolved.</hi> 3. The conſideration of this diſſolution of the creatures, ſhould make theſe of the Lord's People that are furtheſt promoted in holineſſe, very inquiſitive after, and ſtill aſpiring toward a further degree of holineſſe, than what they have formerly attained; knowing that the greater degree of holineſſe they attain unto, the more comfort ſhall they have now, and the more glory when Chriſt cometh: for, the Apoſtle putteth this queſtion to his own heart, and the hearts of all the Lord's People, <hi>What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons ought ye to be, &amp;c?</hi> 4. That holineſſe which ſhould be aimed at by the Lord's People, and which will be comfortable to them, and approven of God, now and hereafter, muſt be manifeſted in all the parts of their converſation, both in their outward carriage, and ſecret practice, in their common affairs and religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, in duties of Gods immediate Worſhip, and in duties relating to their neighbour, as is imported in this, <hi>What manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and godlineſſe?</hi> 5. In the diſcharge of all the duties of holineſſe, Chriſtians ought to look much to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of their perſons, that they be reconciled with God through Chriſt, and daily renewing the friendſhip, by the exerciſe of godly ſorrow for ſin, and a living faith in the Mediator, and by keeping their hearts in frame for the particular duties of holineſſe they are called to: for, the Apoſtle doth not put the queſtion, how holy ought our converſation to be? but, <hi>what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godlineſſe?</hi> 6. If the holieſt on earth would put their conſcience to ſpeak to them, after ſerious conſideration of the terror and glory of the ſecond coming of Chriſt, they would be much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:105751:170"/>
with their preſent meaſure of holineſs, and would have their deſires quickned, and their endeavours ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened after a further meaſure thereof, as is imported in this queſtion of the Apoſtles, put to his own, and others conſcience, <hi>What manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godlineſſe?</hi> including himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>

                  <p>From the conſideration of that comfortable ſtate that Believers have to look for beyond time, the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to ſerious and conſtant diligence in making uſe of the Bloud and Spirit of Chriſt for the doing away of their ſinful ſpots, as the only way wherein they may expect true peace when Chriſt cometh, which is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ſame with the firſt uſe of his former doctrine, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.

of everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, ſhould be ſo far from making them that have it negligent and remiſſe in holy duties that it ſhould be a ſpecial motive and engagement to the ſame, that ſo they may honour Him who hath made ſure for them that heavenly inheritance after time, and alloweth them the comfortable expectation of it in time: for, this exhortation to Believers, is inferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their confidence, <hi>Wherefore (Beloved) ſeeing ye look for ſuch things, be diligent, &amp;c.</hi> 2. They who have an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven and well-grounded confidence of Heaven, are ſo ſubject to lazineſſe in their duty, and thereby in hazard to loſe or weaken their aſſurance, which is only main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the way of diligence, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. that they have much need to be frequently rouſed up by the word of exhortation, to diligence in their duty: for, it is thoſe whoſe confidence of Heaven the Apoſtle queſtioneth not, but ſuppoſeth to be well-grounded, whom he doth here (as often before) exhort to <hi>give diligence.</hi> 3. It is not unlawful for the Lord's People to look upon the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the reward which free-grace hath prepared for them, and thereby to provoke their own hearts to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in their duty: Though the reward be neither the main, nor the only motive of a Chriſtian to his duty, Yet it is one that may warrantably be made uſe of, as here the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Wherefore (Beloved) ſeeing ye look for ſuch things,</hi> (to wit, the new Heavens and the new Earth, ſpoken of in the former verſe) <hi>be diligent.</hi> 4. The main thing whereabout Chriſtians diligence ought to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, is, The waſhing away of the ſpots of their by paſt guiltineſſe, by the frequent application of the Bloud of Chriſt, and the changing of their polluted natures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are inclined to defile themſelves further, by the vertue of the Spirit of Chriſt; both which may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this, <hi>without ſpot, and blameleſs,</hi> which is here holden forth as the object of Chriſtians conſtant and ſerious <hi>diligence.</hi> 5. Although there be now many ſpots, and much to blame in the beſt, who may, ſo long as they are in time, cry, Uunclean, unclean; Yet theſe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:105751:173"/>
who get grace to be ſeriouſly diligent (as the word here ſignifieth) in imploying of Chriſt for pardon of by-paſt guiltineſſe, and for ſtrength in the battel againſt ſin for time to come, ſhall be found by Him when He cometh <hi>without ſpot, and blameleſs.</hi> 6. Much ſweet peace and quietneſs when Chriſt cometh, whether at death or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. will be found in the ſpirits of thoſe who make it their ſerious work in time, to have their daily guiltineſſe waſhen away by the application of the Bloud of Jeſus, and their filthy natures changed by the power of His Spirit; and, on the contrary, much fearful unquietneſſe, and bitter anxiety will be at that time in their hearts who carry their unpardoned guilt, and unrenewed nature, to their end with them, without any ſerious diligence for removal of either: for, the words in the Original are, <hi>That ye being without ſpot, and blameleſſe, may be found by Him in peace;</hi> importing that theſe, and none but theſe, will have peace when He cometh. 7. The thoughts of that peace which diligent Believers will have at Chriſt's coming, and of that unquietneſſe which will be then in the hearts of others, ought to provoke all that love their own peace, to much diligence, in making uſe of Chriſt for pardon of ſin, and victory over it: for, the Apoſtle maketh this an alluring motive to diligence, that ſuch, and none elſe, ſhall be <hi>found in peace, without ſpot, and blameleſſe.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth uſe of the former doctrine, both anent the delay of Chriſt's ſecond coming, and the manner thereof, is, For upſtirring of the Lord's People ſeriouſly to ponder, what work the Lord is about while His ſecond coming ſeemeth to be delayed, to wit, the working and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of ſaving grace in His own, and fitting of them for that eternal ſalvation which He is to bring with Him,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105751:173"/>
for which work, time and pains are neceſſary; and this uſe the Apoſtle beareth-in upon them, as a thing that had been much preſt, from the ſame ground, upon theſe ſame <hi>Hebrews,</hi> by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> of whom he ſpeaketh with much love and reſpect, as a man dear to him, and faithfull according to his talent. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The way to quiet our hearts under the delay of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of promiſes, is, to have them much exerciſed with the conſideration of that work which the Lord is about during the delay, how much it ſerveth for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſpiritual and eternal welfare: for, this way would the Apoſtle have the Lord's People to lay their reckoning, that every dayes ſparing of the world is given to them for making faſt-work of their peace with God, and fitting of them for glory, that ſo their hearts might be quieted under the delay, <hi>And account that the long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the Lord is ſalvation.</hi> 2. Theſe Truths which have been often, and by ſeveral of the Lords Miniſters, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly preſt upon the Lords people, ought to have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial weight with them, as being atteſted by many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to be the mind of God, more fully cleared, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with a new reliſh, from ſeveral hands: for, by this the Apoſtle bears-in the ſtudy of holineſs and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the day of judgment, that both he and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had agreed in ſubſtance upon the uſe that was to be made of the doctrine of Chriſt's ſecond coming; <hi>Even as our beloved brother Paul alſo hath written.</hi> 3. All the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters of Chriſt ought to be ſo far from lifting up themſelves above their fellow-labourers, or leſſening the reputation of their perſons and labours among the Lords People, even although their fellow-labourers be in ſome things inferiour to them or differing from them; yea, and have ſharply rebuked them for their failings, That by the contrary, they ought to entertain, and to expreſſe love and eſteem of them, and to conciliate reſpect to them, and to their gifts and labours among the Lord's People <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord hath not given a like meaſure of gifts and qualifications for His Service to all his faithful Servants, but to ſome moe, to ſome, fewer talents, that every one may make uſe of another, and none may expect fulneſſe but in Chriſt Himſelf: for, that there were diverſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, even among the Apoſtles, is imported in this, that <hi>Paul, according to the wiſdom given unto him, hath written.</hi> 5. Whatever meaſure of gifts or graces any have more than another, it is a free gift of God's, and therfore ought to be humbly and thankfully poſſeſt, and carefully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for His honour, who ought to be acknowledged as author of theſe gifts, not only by thoſe that have them, but by every one who doth diſcern them in others: for, while this Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>Paul's</hi> wiſdom, He calleth it <hi>the wiſdom given him.</hi> 6.

Although it be the duty of one faithful Miniſter to keep up the credit of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other among the People, Yet ought their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions one of another to be in ſobriety, ſuch as may not detract from the due eſteem of thoſe whom they do not commend, and ſuch as may lead peoples thoughts above them that are commended, to God as the author and free-giver of any thing commendable in them: for, this Apoſtle doth ſufficiently commend <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; his Writings, while he ſaith of him, <hi>According to the meaſure given him, he hath written.</hi> 8.

Yet it is very lawfull, and the duty of the moſt eminent Miniſters of Chriſt, to make uſe of the Gifts and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of their Fellow-labourers, for clearing of the Truth to themſelves and others, and ſometimes to cite their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for gaining the greater credit to Truth with people: for, ſo doth this Apoſtle here, who not only preſſeth the ſame Truth that <hi>Paul</hi> had preſt, but is not aſhamed to a vow that he had peruſed <hi>Pauls</hi> Writings to thoſe <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as alſo all the reſt of his Epiſtles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had found that which did agree with his doctrine, <hi>Even as our beloved brother Paul hath alſo written.</hi> 9. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath not put his name to that Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which is extant in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either becauſe he was hatefull to the unconverted <hi>Jews,</hi> or ſuſpected by weak Converts, who were too much addicted to the Levitical Law; or, becauſe he was ſufficiently known and of unqueſtioned authority with the ſtronger ſort; Yet this place of Scripture putteth it out of doubt, that he is the Author thereof: for, it is clear that this Apoſtle writeth both his Epiſtles to the Twelve Tribes, by comparing 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.1. and 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.1. with 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.12. and here he aſſerteth that <hi>Paul</hi> alſo had written to them; which writing of <hi>Paul's</hi> can be no other than that Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> which is extant, 1.

Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Although the frequent preſſing of neceſſary Truths upon People, be oftentimes a burden to their corrupt nature, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.33.

Thoſe Truths which are moſt darkly propounded in Scripture, are not impoſſible to be underſtood, if men would ſeriouſly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their wit about them, and humbly imploy Chriſt for underſtanding, as the Saints have done, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.33, 34, 97. for, the Apoſtle ſaith only, there <hi>are ſome things hard</hi> (importing, not only that there are many things plain, but alſo that there is nothing impoſſible) <hi>to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</hi> 5 Although humane learning, being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the uſe thereof, may prove a bleſſed mean of fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men for the ſervice of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.22. and 22.3. Yet it is not ſo much the want thereof, nor yet any obſcurity that is in the Scriptures, which cauſeth men dangerouſly to miſtake and wreſt the Word of God, as that men will not become humble Diſciples of Chriſt, renouncing their own wit, and giving themſelves up to Chriſt's teaching: for, the word here in the Original, <hi>Unlearned,</hi> is not that which is made uſe of in Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.13. to ſignifie the want of humane litterature, but it is a word that ſignifies to be undiſcipled, or not taught by Jeſus Chriſt; in which ſenſe, <hi>they that are unlearned do wreſt the Scriptures.</hi> 6.

It is not enough for the Lord's People to maintain that meaſure of grace which they have already attained; but they muſt labour to find the lively exerciſe and daily growth of every grace: for, the Apoſtle, having exhorted to ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe in what they had already attained, doth adde this, <hi>But grow in grace.</hi> 2. Growth in grace is a ſpecial preſervative from apoſtaſie, there being no poſſibility to keep what we have attained, except it be improven, and be upon the growing hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29. for, this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is added to the former, as a ſpecial mean of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtedfaſtneſs, <hi>Grow in grace, &amp;c.</hi> 3. They that would have grace to thrive in their hearts, muſt labour for a daily increaſe of knowledge in their minds concerning Chriſts ſoveraignity, His offices, and the benefits we have by Him: for, as growth in grace is here preſt as a ſpecial mean to ſtedfaſtneſs, ſo growth in knowledge is preſt as a ſpecial mean of attaining to growth in grace; <hi>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 4. It is the duty of all who have any right thoughts of Chriſt, to break forth ſome way in His praiſe, and to aſcribe glory to Him, who, being the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth, is become the Saviour of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and hath cloathed Himſelf with Offices anſwerable to all their neceſſities, as is imported in the names of Chriſt that are here: for, the Apoſtle, that knew Him well to be ſuch a one, taketh up the ſong, which all that know Him ſhould follow and keep up in their hearts, <hi>To Him be glory.</hi> 5. Praiſe is a duty, wherewith all our other duties ſhould be cloſed, both for the help we find in them, and for the pardon we believe to obtain for our failings; upon both which grounds the Apoſtle cloſeth his Epiſtle with praiſe, <hi>To Him be glory.</hi> 6. Praiſe is an exerciſe, for the diſcharge whereof, not only all our time, but the long age or day of eternity, as the word here ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, is little enough; <hi>To Him be glory, both now and for ever. Amen.</hi>
